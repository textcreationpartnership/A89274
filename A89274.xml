            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He occaſion of the penning and publiſhing the enſuing Diſcourſe was this; Being at <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1653. I was invited to a publick Meeting at <hi>Black Friers,</hi> the end of which, as I was informed, was to ſeek the face of God for the peace and welfare of the Nation, and for his direction and bleſſing on the Authority over us, to that end; as likewiſe for inſtructing themſelves, and others, what ground of encouragement they had, and in what manner they ought to ſeek and purſue the ſame. Upon which account I was alſo requeſted to joyn with them, in preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a word of inſtruction, or exhortation, to that purpoſe. I could not on a ſudden think wherein I might more pertinently, and profitably ſpend that little time I had amongſt them, and on ſuch an occaſion, than in the opening thoſe two verſes the ſubject of the following Diſcourſe; And having but about an hours time permitted me there, ſome after-conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations moved me to make them more publick with ſome enlargement, (which then I had not opportunity for, though the principal heads of inſtruction within mentioned were then briefly ſpoken to) and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>1 I perceived ſome in the firſt hearing of them were not fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſome did then teſtifie their diſ-ſatisfaction (at leaſt as to the pertinency of the matter to the preſent occaſion) though not in any thing particularly, nor in ſuch manner as they might have anſwer with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for which neither was there opportunity at that time; for which cauſe I thought it was needful for me, by this means to ſpeak more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly to the things then but briefly touched, eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring herewith alſo that which follows.</p>
            <p>2 That I am very apprehenſive of ſome ſuitableneſſe of the matters here treated of, not only to that preſent occaſion, but to the needs of the preſent time, being ſenſible, that the laſt and perrilous times are coming upon us; in which though for preſent there is, as ſomtimes paſt there hath been (through the mercy of God) ſome abatement of bodily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution (as <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 33, 34.) yet by means of many (in ſuch a time as this, when profeſſion of godlineſs is almoſt grown into faſhion) clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:118359:3"/>
to them by flatteries; and likewiſe, many of them of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding falling to the pernicious and deceivable wayes of the ſpirit of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, (as <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 34, 35.) Iniquity abounds under ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and forms of godlineſſe, by meanes of which Vizards it gets enlargement abundantly, and indiſcernably; and the love of many wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth cold, to Jeſus Chriſt, and to the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and to the people that keep the Commandements of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus; and ſo that love to all men for Chriſts ſake, that the grace of God bringing ſalvation to all, inſtructeth and leadeth too, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned love among Beleevers one to another; There is a general decay of love, through the general over-ſpreading and abounding of iniquity; And knowing that in ſuch a time eſpecially it is needful, and a ſuitable converſation to the Goſpel, for all Beleevers according to their capacity to ſtrive together, yea to contend, though with meekneſſe, yet with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe, for the faith of the common Salvation, as it was once delivered to the Saints, to be held forth to the world for the good of all; and alſo to conſider one another to provoke to love, and to good works, and that, ſo much the more as they are ſenſible of the day approaching, exhorting one another daily, while it is called to day, leſt any bee hardned through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin; yea, to be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, in preaching the Word, reproving, rebuking, exhorting, with all long-ſuffering, and Doctrine; to watch in all things, endure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, doe the work of Evangeliſts, or Meſſengers of peace, each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that furniture God hath given them, that the truth of the Goſpel, and the love of that truth may remain with thoſe that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart; and others may be admoniſhed by it, that their feet may be turned unto his teſtimonies. Theſe conſiderations moved me to be willing (at the requeſt of others) to let my weakneſſe appear, if happily through it God may be glorified, and others may reap the benefit. Which that they may, I deſire the Scriptures may be ſearched, and compared. And that the Lord may give us underſtanding in all things according to our needs, and capacities, and as he ſees good for us, is the prayer of</p>

               <item>Hence this Inſtruction; That the ſervice not onely of the firſt Apoſtles, but alſo of the ſecondary and ſucceeding Miniſters in the Goſpel of Chriſt, It was and is to be exerciſed amongſt and for the good of all men, indefinitly, and generally, where ever by Gods providence they are ſet. p. 3. &amp;c.</item>
               <item>Uſes of this Inſtruction.</item>
               <item>1 To inform of the great love of God to the world, to all men. p. 7</item>
               <item>2 To reprove ſuch as forbid, or hinder the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to all, or any of them, that they might be ſaved. p. 10</item>
               <item>3 To exhort Beleevers, to mind the main deſign for which they are ſet and preſerved in the world; The glory of God in the good of all men. p. 11</item>
               <item>Motives thereto to be conſidered by them are,</item>
               <item>1 Their engagement, they are debtors to all men. p. 13</item>
               <item>2 The love of God in Chriſt to all men. p. 14</item>
               <item>3 The many examples of Gods ſervants before. p. 15</item>
               <item>4 The recompence of Reward, both preſent and eternal. p. 17</item>
               <item>2 From the firſt and general part of the Exhortation, as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it ſelf, and with relation to the occaſion fore-ſhewed, This Inſtruction, That in purſuance of that great Deſigne, for the good of all men, and that to that purpoſe Beleevers miniſtration may be bleſſed, and ſuccesful among them. <hi>Firſt of all Supplications, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Interceſſions, and giving of thanks are to be made for all men.</hi> p. 18</item>

                  <pb facs="tcp:118359:4"/>For more diſtinct opening this,</item>
               <item>1 Who are the All men for whom Prayers and Thanks-giving are to be made. All mankind, every of them, in an acceptable time. p. 19, &amp;c.</item>
               <item>2 Who thoſe are by whom ſuch Prayers &amp;c. are to be made; In anſwer to which, That all men every where as natural men conſidered, have an effectual door opened, and liberty afforded, and are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and call on him while he is near:</hi> But that it is eſpecially required of Beleevers, who are therefore furniſhed to it to make Prayers and Thanks-givings for themſelves and others, even for all men; And of them, That men as oppoſed to women, pray every where, women being not permitted as the mouth of the reſt to ſpeak in every place, not in publick and mixt Aſſemblies. p 26, &amp;c.</item>
               <item>3 What thoſe Supplications, Prayers, and Interceſsions are which are to be made for all men. That is firſt ſhewed according to the ſignification of the ſeveral termes. p. 31</item>
               <item>And then by ranking them under two general heads.</item>
               <item>1 The petitioning of good things in the behalf of them all, that are not directly for them all, or for bleſsings to be conferred on them all: But for them in reſpect of their end and tendency for the good of all. p. 32</item>
               <item>And of theſe firſt, Thoſe prayers for peculiar blesſings to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on Beleovers in the World (according to their capacity) to furniſh them for the good of others; yea for peculiar National bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings on thoſe Nations, on which his name is called; And that alſo for the good of other Nations. p. 33</item>
               <item>2. Thoſe prayers that are directly againſt many particular perſons, and Nations, as walking in their evill purpoſes and wayes (<hi>viz.</hi>) for the blaſting and confuſion of them therein: Yet thoſe in reſpect of their end, and tendency, are generally for the good of all men, yea particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for the good of all thoſe perſons or Nations againſt whom they are made, while yet they are not wholly reprobated. p. 36</item>

               <item>5 The ground or account upon which Prayers and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings are to be made for all men, That ſhewed to be the truth and verity of that which is the bottome-cauſe, and occaſion of giving thanks to God in the Name of Chriſt for all men; And that firſt, by a brief opening the following verſes to the Text. p 50</item>
               <item>And then by propounding theſe particular Inſtructions from the conſideration of thoſe verſes.</item>
               <item>1 That Jeſus Chriſt by the will and appointment of the Father hath given himſelf, and is accepted a ranſome for all men, ſo as therein he hath redeemed them, in, and by himſelf, from the curſe of the Law being made a curſe for them; and obtained and received into himſelf for them (that in coming in to him any of them might enjoy it) a perfect reſtoration of all their loſſe, yea eternal redemption and life. p. 53</item>
               <item>2 That he is by vertue thereof become a ſtanding and powerful Mediator between God and men. p. 61</item>
               <item>3 That by vertue of his Ranſome accepted, and by means of his mediation continually made for them, he is of the Father to them, a teſtimony in due time, 1. In affording to all as they come to capacity, and need of it, opportunity, ſpace, and means to repentance. p. 66</item>
               <item>2 In ſending forth his good Spirit in the ſupernatural light and power of it, in, and with thoſe mercies and means to bring the light and underſtanding of his goodneſſe to the heart, and thereby to reprove their evils, and turn them to God. p. 69</item>
               <item>And that in all this, <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all.</hi> p. 75</item>
               <item>3 From the laſt and particular part of the Exhortation, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelf (comparing the ſecond with the firſt verſe) and
<pb facs="tcp:118359:5"/>
with relation to the occaſion, and end of the Exhortation fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed. Thence this Inſtruction, That in purſuance of that great Deſign for the good of all men, and particularly (as mainly tending to the furtherance of the ſame) That Believers <hi>may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe, and honeſty, Prayers, and Thankſgivings are to be made</hi> (as in general for all men, ſo) particularly <hi>for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</hi> This opened in theſe branches.</item>
               <item>1 That it tends very much to the good of all men, That Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe, and honeſty,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And in this firſt branch,</item>
               <item>1 What it is to <hi>lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty.</hi> p. 78</item>
               <item>And therein, what is godlineſſe, and how the beleever to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed therein. p. 79</item>
               <item>And what is honeſty in the beleever, and how he to lead his life therein. p. 83</item>
               <item>And how theſe two anſwer to thoſe two great Commands of the Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c. and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> and are found in thoſe two great Commands of the Goſpel, <hi>To beleeve on the Name of him whom God hath ſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and love one another, as he hath given us Commandement.</hi> p. 87</item>
               <item>And then what is that quiet and peaceable life, which the grace of God inſtructs the beleever to lead, in, and according to godlineſs and honeſty. And there, after ſome ſeveral ſignifications of quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and peaceableneſſe briefly hinted, p. 88</item>
               <item>Its eſpecially applied in ſuch a ſenſe, as oppoſed to war, ſtrife, or contention. p. 90</item>
               <item>And ſo the beleever, in, and according to godlineſſe and honeſty, is to lead his life quitly and peaceably.</item>
               <item>1 With reference to thoſe in authority over him. p. 91</item>
               <item>2 Towards all men. p. 95</item>
               <item>3 Eſpecially one with another. p. 98</item>
               <item>2 How the Beleevers leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty, tends ſo much to the good of all men. That ſhewed in two things.</item>
               <item>1 It tends much to the beleevers own advantage, profit, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture for the good of others. p. 102</item>
               <item>2 It tends to the adorning the Name and Doctrine of God our Saviour, amongſt, and before them. And that ſhewed in divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. p. 104</item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:118359:5"/>2 That therefore God likes it wel in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and requires it of thoſe whom he ſets in place of Authority, that they ſhould all of them have a ſpecial eye at this, That his people that worſhip him, and would live quietly in the Land, may lead a quiet and peaceable life under their protection and government, p. 110, &amp;c.</item>
               <item>3. What thoſe things are in generall that will tend to this, and which are therefore required of Governours, that Beleevers may lead ſuch a life.</item>
               <item>1 They are to afford them liberty, and protection in ſuch liberty, for quiet, and peaceable worſhipping of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and endeavouring the good of others, as the grace of God by Chriſt, their Great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver inſtructeth them, p. 113</item>
               <item>And by way of removing ſome ſcruple in this, 'tis ſhewed, That they are to let the Tares and Wheat grow together, till the end of the world, and ſo to afford that liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and protection in that liberty, to all that pretend to deſire to ſeek and worſhip God in Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Word, or Scriptures; if under ſuch pretence they do not groſly blaſpheme, or cast off the outward acknowledgement of that name, or do that which directly tends to the injury or damage of others, in name, eſtate, or life; or move ſedition; and ſo they ſhal afford ſuch liberty and protection to all that are quiet in the Land. p. 115</item>
               <item>2 They are to give unto them thoſe things that are juſt and equal, by an equal diſtribution of Juſtice, and thorowly executing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between a man and his neighbour, p. 121</item>
               <item>3 They are to ſeek peace and purſue it, among thoſe under their Government, and with other Nations; <hi>As much as is poſſible, live peaceably with all men,</hi> p. 122</item>
               <item>Some ſcruples againſt this raiſed from ſome miſ-apprehenſions of Prophecies anſwered; in which is ſhewed, That in the Wars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Commotions of the latter days, towards, and yet before the end, Saints as Saints, and for their Kingdome, are not to be actors in them; but after that conſideration only ſpectators of them, though after other conſiderations, as Members of the Nation where they live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they may in ſome caſes act with the reſt; &amp; that they are part of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, evils, or judgements of the latter dayes; and that though God occaſionally brings forth much good by them, to the reſtraint and hinderance of bodily Perſecution, yet they are accompanied with more abounding of Spiritual iniquity. And that though theſe Judgements and Battels be of the Lords permiſſion, and gracious

ordering, and ſuch as in which he begins to ſtain the pride of the glory of ſuch as have lifted up the Horn againſt him, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for the ſtirring up the Nations to them are unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. p. 124, &amp;c.</item>
               <item>And that thoſe Propheſies of the totall deſtruction of all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and bringing down their power, and giving the Kingdomes under the whole Heavens to the Saints, is not to bee accompliſhed till the Reſurrection of the juſt, and ſo not till the Lord himſelf come, and bring all that ſleep in Jeſus with him, and then it ſhall be accompliſhed together, by a wonderfull and more immediate put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of the Arm of the Lord, yea all his Saints from firſt to laſt ſhall then have that honour with him, and no other. p. 128.</item>
               <item>Some uſe of theſe conſiderations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 132</item>
               <item>4 What that is that will eſpecially furniſh Governours to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things required of them, and ſo is eſpecially to be deſired for them. And that is ſhowed to be wiſdome in the knowledge of Chriſt, and the glory of God, as appearing in the face of him, as to us declared in the Gospel. p. 138</item>

The Apoſtle having, I ſay, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this Commandement and charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Chap. 1. 3, 4, 15, 18. That according to the Propheſies that went before on him, and by that furniture of Inſtruction, Gifts, and Grace conferred on him, he might war a good warfare, holding faith, and a good conſcience, &amp;c. this ſervice to which he was furniſhed and appointed, being weighty, and that it might be bleſſed and ſuccesful, He doth therefore, in theſe two verſes that we have read, exhort, that firſt of All, in the firſt place, alwayes, and in order of nature as the firſt thing, in, and unto All his ſervice, not onely himſelfe, but All his Brethren with him that have their faces Sion-ward, whoſe hearts joyne in the promoting and furtherance of ſuch ſervice, ſhould have their eye, or heart directed unto God, for Accommodation, Preſervation, Bleſſing, in, and unto ſuch ſervice, as he appoints them too, <hi>Even as the eyes of a ſervant are to the hand of his maſter, and of a maid to the hand of her miſtreſſe,</hi> Pſal. 123. 1, 2. And that this is the occaſion, end and ſcope of this exhortation, appears, not onely by conſidering the word <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> as it hath relation to the latter end of the foregoing Chapter, but alſo by comparing herewith the 7. and 8. verſes of this Chapter, which alſo clearly ſhew the word <hi>Therefore</hi> in the firſt verſe, to have relation eſpecially, and directly, to the 18. and the beginning of the 19 verſes of the firſt Chapter; In that 7. and 8. verſes of this ſecond Chapter, the Apoſtle declaring his owne Ordination, Appointment, and Furniture, to be one of the prime Apoſtles, and Teachers of the Gentiles, in the faith and verity of the Teſtimony of God concerning Chriſt, mentioned in the 4, 5, and 6. verſes, as now come forth, and committed to them; he Therefore, on this occaſion, and to the end his miniſtration may be bleſſed, profitable and ſuccesfull, doth will or deſire that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands without

wrath and doubting; So here having commit ted this Commandement and Charge unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> as one of thoſe ſecondary Miniſters, who having beleeved, and been reconciled, and received the word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation in believing, by Jeſus Chriſt, and mediately through their word, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 20. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19, 20. were to carry on the ſame work, holding faſt the platform of ſound Doctrine which they had received from them, and ſo building upon, and according to the foundation of Doctrine as laid by them, who as wiſe maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builders had laid the foundation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 11. 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10.

            <p>Now in That the Apoſtle in ſuch an exhortation to Prayers and Thankſgivings, thus occaſioned, and to ſuch an end, That the ſervants of Chriſt in the Goſpel might war a good warfare, &amp;c. as foreſhewed, doth exhort, <hi>That Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Thanks be made for All men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It doth fully imply, and ſignifie to us this note of Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the ſervice, or warfare, not onely of the firſt Apoſtles, but that alſo to which</hi> Timothy, <hi>and ſo the ſucceeding, ſecondary Miniſters in the Goſpel of Chriſt, are furniſhed and appointed, It was, and is to be exerciſed Amongſt, and for the good of All men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, and generally where ever by Gods providence they are ſet.</hi>
            </p>

or Meſſengers, were by him ſent into the world, as the Father ſent him in reſpect of his Miſſion for Miniſtration of the Goſpel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 18. And after his Reſurrection, as his Ambaſſadors, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was enlarged by him, on the Account of his owne as to the extent of his Miniſtration, or plaine preaching the peace he had made, being enlarged by the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19. They were to goe into All the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature, <hi>To preach among the Gentiles the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt,</hi> in ſuch manner as before it had not been named, to which they were immediately furniſhed and commiſſionated; and to make All men ſee, &amp;c. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8, 9. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 15 - 21. And this grace and Apoſtleſhip they received for obedience to the Faith among all Nations for his name, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5.

And that they might make all men ſee, what is the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the myſtery, which had been hid from generations paſt; As they were to baptize the Nations with their word or doctrine as the firſt and maine part of the work to which they were ſent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. ſprinkling or dropping that on them, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 1, 2, 3. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 21. So alſo together there with as an outward ſeale of the truth thereof, they were to baptize them with water alſo in his name, even the Nations, whoſoever of them would, them, and theirs, every one of them, even as the Jaylor was baptized, he, and all his, ſtreight-way on his firſt owning and liſtening to the report of the Goſpel, and being willing to be inſtructed therein; and therein alſo as well as by their word, they preached the word of the Lord to him, and to all that were in his houſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 32, 33. which alſo is according to <hi>Peters</hi> Doctrine opening the Commiſſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39. comparing the 39. verſe, with a place ſpeaking of a like buſineſſe in our Types, to which the Apoſtle there ſeems to have apt and evident Alluſion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10. 14. And then alſo to teach theſe Nations, as they had outwardly baptized them, in the name, and unto the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Jeſus Chriſt as come in the fleſh, to obſerve whatever Jeſus Chriſt did command his Diſciples; And all this they were to do for the diſcipling the Nations, the gathering or drawing them to Chriſt from their former ſtate of darkneſſe, and ſhadow of Death,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118359:8"/>

            <p>And therefore alſo hath God preſerved a ſucceeding Generation of ſuch as through the taſtes of his graciouſneſs in the appearance of his love in Chriſt to man-ward, having been drawn to him, built upon him, and ſo reconciled to God by Jeſus Chriſt, and received the word of Reconciliation.

            <p>This conſideration may be uſeful, Firſt, to informe of the great love of God to the world; to All men, which is herein exceedingly commended; for as God ſent not his Sonne, ſo neither doth he ſend the Goſpel, and Servan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If God had intended to ſlay us, he would not have found out, and accepted ſuch a ſacrifice for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor would he have ſent his Meſſengers, to ſhew us, and tell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us ſuch things as theſe: I ſay, we may well thus argue, ſeeing God himſelfe argues, and poſitively affirmes on his Word and Oath, the truth and cordialneſſe of his love to man-ward, from the latter of theſe onely, namely his ſending his Meſſengers to call and warne them, (which indeed alſo ſhews the truth of the former, the proviſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and way opened for them all to turne to him; the declaration of which is the ſumme of their meſſage received of him, 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 1-5. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. which if it were not ſo, he would not have told them) ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 7. 10, 11. God having ſet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> as a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and other Watchmen, to hear the word at his mouth, and to warne the people; He did thus reaſon againſt their unbeleefe and murmuring, whereas they ſaid, Though he by his Watchmen called and warned them, yet he did not therein lift up the yoak of thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome on their Jawes, as hee ſaith he doth while he ſets meat before them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 4. but left them neceſſarily under the power and bondage of their iniquities, under which they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally; ſo that when he called, they could not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heare and turne, and how ſhould they then live? To this God anſwers, and argues it from his having ſet Watchmen among them, <hi>Therfore ſay unto them, As I live, ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked,</hi> of ſuch wicked men as doe dye, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. he hath now no pleaſure, none at all, after any conſideration, neither ſecret,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118359:10"/>
nor revealed, in their death, but that they ſhould turn and live; though afterward when the day of his grace and patience is at an end towards them, his heart will ſtand otherwiſe affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, though no change in him; their condition being wholly changed, they being become perfectly one of the Seed of the Serpent, wholly rejected of God; Then he will laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh: But now he is ſlow to anger, and his very forbearance is ſalvation, and ſhews that he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance, and be ſaved, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. 16. And that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as we have noted by his Declaration of himſelfe, and heart towards them, in ſending his ſervants, and uſing other means to proclaim his goodneſſe to them, and call, and lead them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. For I the Lord (ſaith he) ſpeak righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and declare things that are right, and therefore have not ſpoken in ſecret, or covertly, as one that would not that all ſhould underſtand me, or take me at my word, nor have willed my ſervants to uſe hidden things of diſhoneſty.

As one that hath no pleaſure in your deſtruction, I have ſent to call you; and becauſe I know you have no ſtrength in your ſelves, as of your ſelves, but are naturally dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſinnes, Therefore all the day long while I have been calling you to behold me, I ſtretched out my hand to a rebellious people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 1, 2.

While God by Jeſus Chriſt, in any means, but eſpecially in the declarations and invitations of his Goſpel, is calling to any of us; This is indeed a time of finding with him, and ſo urged as a motive to perſwade us to ſeek him now, and that the wicked ſhould forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and turn to the Lord, who aſſures us he will multiply pardon, of which he hath given his Son for a ſtanding witneſſe, not onely to make propitiation for them, but alſo by verttue of his mediation with the Father for

We beſeech you receive not this Grace of God in vain, ſpeaking of Gods furniſhing and ſending his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with the word of reconciliation to beſeech them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. For (ſaith he) he (namely God) ſaith, <hi>I have heard thee in a time accepted, in a day of ſalvation have I helped thee; Behold now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> The firſt part of the ſaying we have in <hi>Iſa</hi> 49. 7, 8. ſpoken, and applyed particularly to the Perſon of Chriſt; Gods hearing him is ſpoken with reference to his Interceſſion, or Mediation with the Fathers for us, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the infinite and abiding vertue of his ſufferings in that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his own body perfected through them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20. Gods helping, or upholding him is ſpoken with evident reference to his Miniſtration, which is now carried on by his ſervants; The Scriptures compared ſhew, Firſt, 'Tis by vertue of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, who is the Mediator between God and men, by and with the vertues of his having given himſelf a ranſome for All, that the Servants of Chriſt, or the Meſſengers he ſends of any ſort, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and continued in the world, that ſo ill requite, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt him, yet to bear witneſs of him, and call to him; and ſo it appears in the following verſes of this Chapter, That on the account of his Mediation daily made, by vertue of the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome once given for all, he is alſo a teſtimony, or teſtified in due time, to men in their ſeverall ages, and to every man in ſeaſon, while it might be for his good. Secondly, That while the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Interceſſion of Chriſt being continued with the Father, ſo far prevails for forbearance, that ſuch teſtimonies of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and means of perſwading, and calling to repentance, in which alſo his good Spirit is certainly converſant, are ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and extended unto any, This is ſtill the accepted time, the time in which they may be accepted; yea the heart of God is cordially deſirous they ſhould come in his Drawings, and be accepted, now is the day of ſalvation; <hi>Oh that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſſe, and for his wonderful works for the children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 This Doctrine gives occaſion of reproof, unto ſuch as endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to forbid, or hinder the plaine preaching and aſſerting the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118359:11"/>
truth of the Goſpel to the Gentiles, to every, or any man, as men conſidered, that they might be ſaved, which doe they, that though they pretend to honour and magnifie Chriſt, yet doe hide that Viſion of all which God hath revealed in him, from the people, or render it as a ſealed Book, a Riddle, whoſe meaning lyes not in its expreſſions, or is according to the Import of them, they therein take away the Key of Knowledge, and neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves by the door, which is that opened in Chriſt for all men to the Father, nor ſuffer thoſe that are entring to go in; and they alſo (though happily not at ſo high a rate, if that be all) that forbid little children to come to Chriſt being brought in their armes, or by their appointment, to whom by Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence they are given to bring up for him, and them to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his name, or the truth of the Goſpels Declaration concerning them, and the promiſe in Chriſt by it, to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed and ſealed in baptizing them in his name; They do alſo therein forbid that kinde of preaching Goſpel to thoſe Parents, and ſo to all men with them, that they might be ſaved. Theſe pleaſe not God, and they are contrary to his great deſign, the good of all men, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>3 Saints may here be exhorted, to mind their main and great deſign, for which they are ſet and preſerved in the world; Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others; Let the ſame minde be in you which was in Chriſt Jeſus, who being equall with God, yet took on him the form of a ſervant, and humbled himſelf to the death of the Croſſe, that ſo the grace of God bringing ſalvation might come to us, wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and made him a Prince and Saviour to be ſo worſhipped, and acknowledged by us; Herein you ſhall yeeld obedience to him, and render that which is but your reaſonable ſervice, in ſuffering this grace to mould you to the ſame minde in love and compaſſion to others, in becoming ſervants to, and for them, that they may be ſaved. Work out therefore your own ſalvation, That which is wrought and perfect in Chriſt, for all men, which you have received by faith; and the efficacies of this (believed) in you, even the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your ſouls, vent it, ſhew it forth, according as this is boyling up, leading, and framing you to deſire, and endeavour
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118359:12"/>
the good of others; For this is God that works in you, both to will, and to do, and that of good pleaſure. Go on confidently therefore in this your might, and do all things, unto which, by, and according to the inſtructions and perſwaſions of this grace of the Goſpel, which is Gods Arm, you are lead, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmurings and diſputings with your own reaſon, and wiſdome, againſt any thing this ſalvation moves you too for others good, leſt therein you be fighters againſt God, and fail of experimenting his preſence and fellowſhip with you, or the working of his mighty power in the efficacies of this ſalvation in, and by you, or make your ſelves unapt to his acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but that on the other hand, you may be blameleſſe, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the Sons of God, in the midſt of a crooked generation, amongſt whom ſhine ye as lights in the world, and ye ſhall ſo ſhine by holding forth the faithful word amongſt them, then alſo ſhall thoſe ſervants of Chriſt that have been inſtrumentall for you, Rejoyce that they have not run in vain; for if you have no ſavour of the knowledge of God, and his goodneſſe, ſo as you make it manifeſt to all men, in every place, according to capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and opportunity given you, you are fit for nothing, you come not yet up to the great deſign of God in calling and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing you by his grace, and ſetting you in the world, and ſo it may ſeem as in reſpect of you, that they have run in vain, that have been inſtruments of good to you, though their work ſhall be with their God. Be exhorted therefore to ſuffer the grace of God to make you one with him in his Deſign; and in purſuance of it, Let your light ſo ſhine before men that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven, <hi>Phil. 2. Mat.</hi> 5. 13. 15. Dearly beloved (ſaith <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 11, 12.) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you as ſtrangers and pilgrims abſtain from fleſhly luſts that war againſt the ſoul, having your converſation honeſt, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with gravity, and ſincerity, ſingle and chaſte to God, and your main deſign to glorifie him amongſt others, and for their good, that the Gentiles in the day of their viſitation may glorifie God; who when the inſtructions and reproofs of the Goſpel begin to light on their hearts, will preſently turn their eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, ſuppoſing, if there be indeed truth in this Goſpel, and in the inſtructions thereof, leading them ſo to worſhip God; If there
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118359:12"/>
be ſuch preciouſneſſe in Chriſt, ſuch ſweetneſſe and ſatisfaction in the love of God to Man-ward therein diſcovered; that then thoſe that do indeed know it, and have taſted the graciouſneſſe of the Lord, as you have profeſſed among them, muſt needs be men in their converſation, full of honeſty, walking in all good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God and men, not loving the world, nor the things thereof, not eaſily provoked by any injuries of any ſort extending onely to themſelves, but willingly rather ſuffering wrong, not high-minded, ſelf-willed, or conformed to this world, in the cuſtomes, wayes, or faſhions of it, according to their former luſts in their ignorance; And if accordingly they behold your light herein ſhining, your lamps burning, and you as ſtrangers, travellers, and as men ready waiting for the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Lord; this will be a great and effectuall means to lead them to glorifie God, and acknowledge, As we have heard, ſo we have ſeen in the houſe of our God, they wil then beleeve his word, and the inſtructions thereof to be good, and true; whereas on the other hand, if they behold the contrary in you, it will be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſtumble to them, and lead them to blaſpheme the holy name called upon by you. Oh therefore ly down, and deny your ſelves in this, and be willing to take up your croſſe daily that you may follow him in purſuance of his Deſign for the good of all men. And to provoke, and conſtrain you hereto; Conſider theſe Motives.</p>
            <p>1 You are debtors to all men, Greeks, Barbarians, wiſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, bond, and free; And that upon this account you have been acquainted with that grace of God that brings ſalvation to all men, <hi>Rom. 1. 15. Tit.</hi> 2. 10, 11. Its that grace that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (for to ſuch I ſpeak) and in the receiving which, you have been ſaved, who were ſometimes ſuch, as the worſtamongſt whom you live; but that grace that is in God towards them, in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to you, hath ſaved you; And therein you have received that word of Reconciliation in ſome diſtinct underſtanding of it, and fitneſſe to hold it forth, according to which your ſelves have been reconciled to God, that holds forth matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to every one of them, that one dyed for all, and roſe again; And that this was not onely ſufficient, but effectuall with the Father in the publick Perſon, as if all had dyed; And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118359:13"/>
that all this was ſo effectuall with the Father for them, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially, that it might be effectuall in them, that they which live, every man in his proper age, ſhould not henceforth after this grace is manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Do not you therefore with-hold good from them to whom it is due, or put your light under a buſhel, that was given you to ſhew light to all the houſe.</p>
            <p>2 Yea let the love of Chriſt, and ſo of God in Chriſt to all men, be herewith conſidered, as effectually witneſſed, in that he hath done for them, and doth to them, according as declared in this Goſpel committed to your truſt, and it will conſtrain you; True it is, it doth not conſtrain or lead to ſuch love, or ſervice of love, but upon principles of certainty and truth; it leads not to run at an uncertain, or to fight as thoſe that beat the Air; nor are there other principles of certainty and truth, but theſe, and their companions, upon which it ſo perſwades; that is to ſay, The love of Chriſt doth not conſtrain or lead any man to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to, or perſwade any other man to be reconciled to God, for whom the teſtimony of it doth not aſſure him upon principles of certainty and truth, That Chriſt dyed, and roſe for him, and that ſo effectually with the Father, and cordially in reſpect of its tendency towards him (as foreſhewed.) Its true, many do preach, and exhort, and fight very much, that do not thus judge; but on what account, or the love of what leads them to it, we examine not, doubtleſſe ſome one thing, ſome another: But let this love which you have ſeen, and believed to be in God towards all men in ſending his Son the Saviour of the world, be conſidered by you, and from theſe principles of truth received in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118359:13"/>
it will conſtrain or hemn you in to this ſervice, by filling you with the ſame love, and zeal, for their good, that will not be letted or hindred by any thing; ſeeing alſo your underſtanding from the ſame principles is furniſhed with knowledge of the greatneſſe of the terror of the Lord, againſt thoſe which turn ſuch grace into wantonneſſe, tread under foot ſuch precious bloud, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him that bought them, bring on themſelves deſtruction; which terror you could not otherwiſe have rightly read, but in that face of Chriſt; For who knoweth the power of his Anger? (ſurely none) But here we have a rule given us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which you may have ſome diſcerning of the nature and greatneſſe of it, according to thy fear or worſhip (that name and grace of thine declared, in, and through thy Son, according to which thou mighteſt have been feared or worſhipped by thoſe men to their everlaſting health and comfort) ſuch is, and will be thy wrath againſt all ungodly men that turn thy grace into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 11. Therefore in the beliefe of the exceeding greatneſſe of his love to Man-ward, you have a view of the greatneſſe of his Terror againſt all ſuch ungodly ones as turn it into wantonneſſe, and therefore while yet there may be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and the Decree is not gone forth againſt them, or any of them, you cannot but in the conſtraining operation of this love of Chriſt earneſtly beſeech and perſwade them, and lay down your ſelves to win them; Let that therefore be conſidered by you.</p>

That good will in God towards them, being rendred as the ground of praying for them, plainly ſhews they are all to be prayed for towards whom there is ſuch good will in God, and who they are, ſee and compare theſe Scriptures, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>The grace of God brings ſalvation to all men,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9. <hi>He would not that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> Eze. 33. 11. with Ch. 18. 31. <hi>He hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked;</hi> of ſuch wicked men as do dye, <hi>but that they ſhould turn and live; For God ſent not his Son into the world to condemne the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved,</hi> Joh. 3. 17. even ſuch, as by rejecting when they hear, do bring upon themſelves everlaſting condemnation, verſe 19. with Chap. 12. 47, 48.

him cordially extended by Chriſt) <hi>in his treſpaſſes.</hi> Both Scriptures ſhew, that the things before affirmed concerning them were true and cordially for them, which alſo will be the great reaſon of their everlaſting condemnation in a ſecond Death, they rejecting theſe timely admonitions. Further alſo, not only was our Saviors body given, and bloud ſhed for <hi>Judas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But likewiſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, even while he was thus in time admoniſhing <hi>Judas,</hi> that he might be ſuch a teſtimony in due time to him, and while it might have been for his good, he as the great Mediator between God and man, was earneſtly making Interceſſion for him, even while <hi>Judas</hi> was conceiving his wicked thought and enterpriſe againſt him, and till he was ſo wholly given over, and left of God to Satan, that our Saviours prayer returned again into his boſome, and his prayer (namely <hi>Judas</hi>) became ſin, there being no door for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or turning left, which we cannot conclude to be fully done till after that laſt time of his being wrought upon to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſight and owning of his ſin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 3. which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe might have this tendency to lead him yet again to look to his Maſter with whom was forgiveneſſe; but then running from his Maſter, and to the Prieſts for helpe, he was wholly left to his madneſſe and deſperateneſſe, verſe 4, 5. whence that ſeems to be mentioned as the time and thing in which his ſin was filled up, and ſo wrath came upon him to the uttermoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 18. but when, or whereinſoever that was, this we ſay, till ſuch time as ſinne was finiſhed in him, and had brought forth death, occaſioned an utter ſeparation from God, our Saviour was with earneſtneſſe (as one heartily and much deſiring to prevent his deſtruction) praying for him, as appears <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 4, 5, 6, 7. (which Scripture the Holy Ghoſt ſpake concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> compare verſe 8. with <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 20.) For my love, they are my adverſaries, but I to prayer, or I give my ſelfe to prayer; And that the Holy Ghoſt hereby means prayer for him, and ſo them, other ſuch adverſaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even then while they were acting as adverſaries, appears by the next verſe, in which he ſeems to have reference to this, as a teſtimony of his goodneſſe towards them, They have rewarded me evill for good, and hatred for my love; and alſo by that which follows in the 7. verſe as aptly oppoſed to, or ſet againſt this, Let his prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſin, as who ſhould ſay, becauſe in time he would not ſuffer the love teſtified in, and grace extended by means of my praying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

for him, to have its efficacie upon him; yea further, it appeares that this prayer to which our Saviour did diligently give, or ſet himſelf, while there was any opportunity, was for <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſo for ſuch Adverſaries, even for ſuch good for and to them, as by which their deſtruction, yea the finiſhing their ſinne thereto might yet have been prevented, while he was ſo making interceſſion for them, by comparing this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. which is equivalent with this, and indeed clearly opens it, ſee ver. 7, 8. <hi>Without cauſe they are my adverſaries,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let deſtruction come upon him,</hi> &amp;c. See againe, ver. 11, 12, 13. compared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 3, 4, 5. <hi>They rewarded me evil for good,</hi> ſaith the text; but as for me, my cloathing was ſackcloath, I humbled my Soule with faſting, and my prayer returned into my boſome; but not to be larger in this, it appeares by what hath been ſaid, that the Ranſome, and Mediation of Chriſt is true and cordiall, for ſuch men as by turning his grace therein into wantonneſſe, and denying him that bought them, doe afterwards bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction, and ſo for all and every of Mankinde, and thoſe are the All men here in the text to be prayed for, even all thoſe for whom he gave himſelfe a ranſome, and is the Mediator, that he might be to them a teſtimony in due time.</p>
            <p>Yea further it appeares, that by all men to be prayed for, he meanes all Mankinde, without exception of any, in their ſeverall and proper A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in that inſtancing but one ſort or degree of them particularly, he ſaith expreſly, All of them, though they were then generally the worſt, and thoſe concerning whom there might be moſt occaſion of wrath, and doubting in the Beleever, looking upon them as they were in themſelves, for Kings, and for all in authority; ſo our Saviour exhorts, to <hi>pray for them that deſpitefully uſe us, and perſecute us,</hi> Mat. 5. 44. according to his example, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 34. ſo <hi>Stephen</hi> prayed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly when he breathed his laſt for that very people, who had now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this to their former wickedneſſe, they had rejected the Goſpel, as brought and confirmed by the Apoſtles, and now ſtoned him for Chriſts ſake, whom before they had Crucified, yet kneeling downe he cryed with a loud voyce, <hi>Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge,</hi> Act. 7. 60.

Having in the latter part of the firſt Chapter propounded a remedy againſt, and a way of clenſing from the ſins of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers diſtinct, in the beginning of this Chapter he firſt tels them, <hi>Theſe things he hath written to them that they ſinne not,</hi> and then proceeds in his inſtruction, to enlarge and ſhew the infinite vertue and uſefulneſſe of the ſame remedy for taking away other mens ſins alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thoſe that yet beleeve not, <hi>If any man ſinne;</hi> before he ſaid, <hi>if wee ſinne,</hi> now, <hi>if any man,</hi> diſtinct from we or us, and how to underſtand what he meanes by any man, as diſtinguiſhed from, and oppoſed to us, or we, ſee 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19. 20. <hi>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lyes in wickedneſſe.</hi> Thus then we are to underſtand him according to his owne explication, <hi>Theſe things I write, that yee that are of God, and have knowne him that is from the beginning;</hi> as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 12-14. <hi>ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not;</hi> and then alſo, if any other man ſinne, any of the world that yet lyes in wickedneſſe, any one whatſoever that we have occaſion to converſe with, and ſo ſee his ſin, <hi>We have</hi> (that is, Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have) <hi>an Advocate with the Father,</hi> that we may boldly make uſe of, to preſent all our needs, and matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are according to the wil of God, for our ſelves, and others, and he that is our Advocate, <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world;</hi> and therefore we may thorow and by him, make our prayers for any mans ſin; which is equivalent with, and full as large as this for all men; we ſhal adde no more for proofe of this but only this caution, for a right underſtanding of what is ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is poſſible, and ſometime found, ſome men before their Natural l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fe be ſnatcht from them, may have put themſelves out of the number of this All men to be prayed for, men may have ſo filled up the meaſure of their ſinne, as to have finiſhed it, ſo as it hath occaſioned, or brought forth Death, in an utter rejection, and ſeparation from God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 15 with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16, 17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 30. now if any have ſinned ſo farre as unto Death in ſuch a ſence, God having wholly rejected them, and we ſee, or diſcerne the ſame, that we may ſo judge according to the inſtructions of the Goſpel, then the Goſpel ſaith not we ſhould pray for that ſin, and yet this infringes not at all the truth of the Propoſition, in the termes in which it is delivered; that prayers, &amp;c. are to bee made for all men, for theſe reaſons:</p>
            <p>1 Theſe were of that number All of them once, and ſome time (for God is ſlow to anger, it is his ſtrange and unpleaſing worke wholly to give up any, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 21.) and ſo were then to be prayed for; there
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118359:19"/>
are none that are not to be prayed for, or to be abſolutely prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, but ſuch as have been before prayed for, as comparing the fore-mentioned Scriptures, it appeares we are not to ceaſe praying for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> until their ſinne be unto death, which it is not, til finiſhed, then all the time before while it is not finiſhed, thoſe perſons were to bee prayed for, upon the ſame ground and principles of certainty and truth that any others are. The truth of this is confirmed in thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 16. &amp; 11. 14. &amp; 14. 11. where the Prophet is required, not to pray any more for that people, nor to lift up a cry or prayer for them, the reaſon we have in the fore-going and following Verſes of thoſe Chapters, like unto that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24, 25. &amp;c. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 12, 13. &amp; 66. 1-4. becauſe God had long cryed unto them in his Spirit, by the Prophets and other meanes, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 9-11, 12. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 3-12 13. to amend their wayes, not to truſt in lying words, &amp;c. and waited long that he might be gracious to them, and yet they would not hear, he had called, and they anſwered not, but ſet at nought all his counſel, and would none of his reproofe; which ſhewes, that all that time while he had done ſo, his Servants according to his good and acceptable wil, were not to ceaſe praying for them; ſo that even theſe were to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and that in an acceptable time.</p>
            <p>2 When Sinne is ſo wholly finiſhed, as it hath brought forth death, in an utter ſeparation from God, then they being ſo rejected of him, are left to the power of the Tempter, and their owne deluſions they have choſen, in which condition they are become one with Satan, and ſo of the ſeed of the Serpent in a full ſenſe, of the Devil, and ſo in farre worſe ſtate than that which is meerly Natural, as derived from <hi>Adam;</hi> Theſe are no longer numbred among all men, as men, or children of men conſidered, but are diſtinguiſhed from them, and ſet out by names far worſe than any, generally applyed to Mankinde, even the children of the wicked one, diſtinct from the field of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 38<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. Sons of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 12. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. the wicked, and ungodly in the higheſt ſenſe, trees twice dead, pluckt up by the roots, for whom is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the blackneſſe of darkneſſe for ever, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. &amp; <hi>Jud.</hi> 12. 15. ſo that though there may be ſome at ſome time living amongſt men, that are not to be prayed ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the Propoſition remaines generally true, That all men, every where, and in all Ages, are to be prayed for, and every particular of them, until in any of them we ſee according to the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Goſpel, that Sinne is finiſhed, and hath brought forth Death,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118359:19"/>
and then they are not to be reckoned by us amongſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of men, as naturall men conſidered; yea God will diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them by ſome diſtinguiſhing notes, As giving them up wholly to a reprobate ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8. to have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that without reproofe (having their conſcience feared) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. in unrighteouſneſſe, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 12. And in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences not vouchfaſing any more to reprove, or call them, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging his ſervants hearts, opening their mouths, and giving them opportunity to preach to, and perſwade them (which he uſually doth, while it is an accepted time, or day of ſalvation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a man or people, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2-11.) <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 33. <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 11-14. or by adding his leſſer and favourable chaſtiſements, and changes in his providences with them, as with others, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 19. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 14. So that the ſpiritual man ſhall in ſome meaſure be able to know, and note them as reprobate ſilver, that God hath rejected.</p>
            <p>Yet here let me give this as my advice; Let none of us be too haſty in paſſing ſentence or judgement on men as ſuch, or in cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to pray for them on ſuch an account, and that for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe God is ſlow to anger; And it is his ſtrange work to reprobate, or give up any to perdition, neither doth he it uſually at once, but with a great deal of ſlowneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by degrees, and is exceedingly unwilling when he hath begun, to do it fully, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, how ſhall I ſet thee as Admah and Zeboim? &amp;c.</hi> Its generally true, He is ſlow to anger, of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions, and repenteth him of the evill. The truth of it may be abundantly ſeen in the caſe of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whom though God often left to his hardneſſe, after he had ſtubbornly and voluntarily hardened himſelfe, and made himſelfe a meet veſſell for ſuch judgements, yet he did not wholly nor altogether leave him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but in part, and graciouſly admoniſhed and wrought on his heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by his judgements and admonitions, againe and againe, and did ſo many a time ſoften him after ſuch his beginnings of harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before he fully left him to it, after which he was not long ſpared; ſo likewiſe in that caſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> weeping over it he ſaid, <hi>How often would I have gathered thee? &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 23. 37. Luke 19. 42. The truth is, it is mentioned as very rare, That God doth ſpare any time in this naturall life ſuch veſſels of wrath as are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118359:20"/>
wholly fitted and given over to deſtruction, though ſometimes ſome he may for wiſe and holy ends, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. yet it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true, The forbearance of the Lord is ſalvation, and it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be <hi>A living Dog, than a dead Lion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The beginnings or firſt comings forth of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that nature have alwayes a merciful tendency, to warne and admoniſh to jealouſie of themſelves, and turning to him, that ſo the full coming forth of them may be prevented, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 11.</p>
            <p>And further to inſtruct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us to this, ſee the frame of ſpirit found in thoſe holy men of God, that well knew his mind, when God bad <hi>Moſes</hi> let him alone that his wrath might waxe hot againſt that people to conſume them, yet he beſought the Lord again for them, and the Lord was intreated of him, and repented of the evill he thought to do unto them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 9, 10, 11, 14. So in thoſe inſtances in <hi>Jeremy</hi> after he was forbidden to pray for the people, Chap. 7. 16. yet ſee how he makes ſupplication for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chap. 10. 23, 24. yea after he is forbidden again, Chap. 11. 14. yet ſee with what earneſtneſſe and affection he makes his prayer again for them, Chap. 14. 7, 8, 9. yea God himſelfe after he had forbidden him the third time, Chap. 14. 11. yet inſtructs him to teach them to humble themſelves before him, and acknowledge their iniquity, and turne to the Lord (in the latter end of that Chapter) with whom they might finde mercy and healing of their backſlidings, in turning, according to the movings, and leadings of his grace, as Chap. 3. 12. 14. 22. Though perſiſting in their ſtubbornneſſe, his minde could not be turned towards them, Chap. 15. 1, 2. Prayers then are to be made for <hi>all men</hi> in a time when God may be found, as is ſhewed.</p>
            <p>We come ſecondly to conſider by whom they are to be made; this is not expreſly anſwered, or ſpoken to in this verſe; but in verſe 8. it is, which gives us occaſion here to conſider it: And it is there anſwered in an indefinite and generall terme, <hi>That men pray every where;</hi> And that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be underſtood, Firſt, either with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the foregoing verſe for the underſtanding the word <hi>Men;</hi> There <hi>Paul</hi> tells us he was appointed a Herauld, or Cryer, a Teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity, and here he wills therefore that <hi>men every where pray, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo by <hi>men</hi> we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>all men every where</hi> even among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to whom
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118359:20"/>
he was ſent, as <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30. God now by his Goſpel <hi>commandeth all men every where to repent; Yea to ſeek the Lord,</hi> verſe 27. So here <hi>Paul</hi> proclaims liberty, and therefore alſo admoniſheth and calls upon them all, and every where, to make prayers to God by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>to ſeek him while he may be found, and call upon him while he is neer,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 6. That ſo they receive not this grace of God in ſending the Goſpel among them in vain, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2. Or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it may be underſtood with relation to the following verſes for underſtanding the word <hi>Men.</hi> In thoſe following verſes, 9, 10. He addes this exhortation to the women alſo, that they demean themſelves as women profeſſing godlineſſe, and not onely amongſt or towards <hi>all men,</hi> but alſo in the Church, or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſemblies of Beleevers of which he ſignifies they were, whom he ſo requireth or exhorteth. Underſtand <hi>men</hi> in the 8. verſe equivalently, and as oppoſed to women, verſe 9. And then it is <hi>all men</hi> indefinitly and generally, unto whom theſe inſtructions and exhortations were primely and eſpecially dedicated, to prepare inſtruct, and furniſh them to ſeek the good of others, that is, men profeſſing godlineſſe (the whole Church, the Aſſemblies or Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhips of Beleevers, they all, and every one of them, men and women are to joyn together in both Prayers and Propheſyings for the good of all.) But in the publick Aſſemblies of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place that men only ſpeak as the mouth of the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in preſenting <hi>Supplications, Prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Interceſsions, and Thanksgivings for all men;</hi> as well as in crying or proclaiming Goſpel to them, or teaching them in ſuch general Aſſemblies, verſe 10, 11. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34, 35. yet women alſo are to be teachers of good things to others, eſpecially the aged women, and that as their greateſt ornament, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 3, 4. yea they may (and its commendable in them) not onely joyne with men, but be fellow-helpers, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers with them in the Goſpel, in both inſtructing and helping forward with their prayers for the good of all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and among, even in ſome private Societies and meetings of their brethren, though not every where (as may be ſeen in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 3. with <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 13, 14.) However then they are of the number by whom <hi>Supplications, Prayers, Interceſsions, and giving of Thanks, are to be made for all men</hi> (though not by them as the mouth of the reſt, in every place, not in ſuch general or publick Aſſemblies, where the Church or whole Congregation is met together in any
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118359:21"/>
one place, yet) they with the reſt as before, and ſo all Beleevers, not <hi>Timothy,</hi> or ſome prime ones amongſt them only, but all indefinitely and together, yea one and other of them that have knowne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved the great love of God in Chriſt to manward, are eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and called upon to pray for others, even for all men; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this two-fold reading of verſ. 8. this we ſhal finde plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in other Scriptures;</p>
            <p>That all men every where and in all Ages have an effectual doore opened for their liberty, or allowance afforded them, and are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and called upon to ſeek and pray unto God, and that more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, now ſince the full coming forth of the Goſpel, in the name of Chriſt, but that it is eſpecially required, and expected of Beleevers, who only are, and are therefore furniſhed with knowledge, and taſts of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſſe to manward, the love of Chriſt inſtructing, and conſtraining them, to make their prayers unto God in the name of Chriſt, for others alſo, even for all men.</p>
            <p>To the firſt part of this Propoſition, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1-4-6, 7. God furniſhes with all the mercies of this natural life, that men in and by them might be led to ſeek him, &amp;c. and by his Goſpel more ſtrongly obligeth and calleth them (with the Declaration of his Sonne, by whom the way is made for them, and who is given for a witneſſe to the people) to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, to call upon him while he is near, even ſuch as are walking in their wicked wayes, harbouring their unrighteous thoughts, labouring for that which is not Bread, are there graciouſly invited and admoniſhed thereto upon ſuch good ground, ſo equivalent to this, that men pray every where without wrath, or doubting, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> invites all the people to truſt in him at all times, and with truſt or confidence to pour out their hearts before him, and that on this account, God is a refuge for us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 8. ſuitable to which is that acknowledgement, and magnifying the riches of Gods grace, thorow the plenteouſneſſe of the redemption with him, <hi>Pſal. 65. 2. O God that heareſt prayer, to thee ſhall all fleſh come;</hi> and thoſe invitations, and admonitions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 1-6. &amp; 96. 7, 8. &amp; 100. and that, <hi>Jam. 1. 5. If any man lack wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, let him ask it of God, who giveth liberally to all men, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth none;</hi> yea let him aske in faith, according as the goodneſſe of God manifeſted moveth and encourageth him; and if he bee in darkneſſe and ſee no light, yet let him look, come unto the name of God as declared in his Son; <hi>Let him come without mony and price,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118359:21"/>
and ſeek unto God for thoſe waters, the Lord will hear them, the God of Iſrael will not for ſake them, but will open rivers in dry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and fountaines in the deſarts,</hi> Iſa. 41. 17, 18. &amp; 50. 10. &amp; 55. 1 True it is, <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is abomination to the Lord, by how much the more he cometh with a wicked minde,</hi> Prov. 15. 8. &amp; 21. 27. &amp; 28. 9. But this is not to put a barre againſt wicked and ſinfull men, that they ſhould not ſeek the Lord, or call upon him as they are exhorted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 6, 7. but to inſtruct and direct them, and all others, to ſeek him indeed, and with the whole heart, not feignedly; for even righteous men may offer the ſacrifices of the wicked, and then ſhal not be therein heard, and it is for their good they are not. <hi>If I,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord wil not heare me,</hi> Pſa. 66. 18. <hi>Every one that ſets up the Idol of his iniquity in his heart, and puts the ſtumbling-block of it before his face, ſets that in his eye, and deſigne, to reſerve his owne purpoſe, and makes that the end of his prayer, the Lord will ſet his face against him, for they ſeek not him, but themſelves,</hi> Ezek. 14. 3. 7. Iſa. 58. Zech. 7. 5, 6, 7. <hi>They refuſe to heare the Law, or receive his instruction, or reproofe, hide their evil deeds from the light, and yet for a pretence ſeek him, and are zealous in multiplying ſacrifices,</hi> as <hi>Prov. 28. 9.

This is generally true, <hi>Every one that ſeeketh find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened;</hi> let that grace of God therefore that bringeth Salvation to all men, move, encourage, and provoke every man <hi>to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Look unto me, and be yee ſaved, all the ends of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the ſecond part of the Propoſition, and ſo for more direct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the query, Who thoſe are by whom eſpecially prayers are to be made for others, even for all men, of whom it is required and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; they are all thoſe that by faith in Jeſus Chriſt have ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment and uſefulneſſe of him as their Advocate with the Father; <hi>If any man ſinne, we have an Advocate;</hi> wee that have beleeved is him, have through faith ſuch uſefulneſſe of him with the Father, as to preſent, and make out, and manage our matters we have through his grace, according to his will, to preſent to him for others as wel as for our ſelves, even for any man; therefore if any of us that have beleeved on the name of the Son of God (for ſo we have good reaſon to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Therefore the Lord ſpeaking unto <hi>Abimelech</hi> concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> tels him, <hi>He is a Prophet, and he ſhall pray for thee, and thou ſhalt live,</hi> Gen. 20. 7. <hi>The effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much,</hi> Jam. 5. 16. <hi>The prayer of the upright is his delight,</hi> Prov. 15. 8. Tis comely for them to have their hearts deſire, and prayer to God for all men in an acceptable time, and that without ceaſing, and therefore alſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally required and expected of them; becauſe they are acquainted with the good will of God concerning men, as manifeſted in Chriſt, ſhewing them good reaſon, ground, and foundation for it, &amp; from thence moving and conſtraining them to it; <hi>Of them to whom much is given ſhall much be required:</hi> Let me then ſay to ſuch, Seeing yee are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and furniſhed to ſuch excellent ſervice with God for the good of others, and it is of ſo continual and general concernment.

            <p>3 What are thoſe Supplications, Prayers, and Interceſſions that are to be made for all men; we may ſay in ſome ſenſe, and after divers conſiderations, All manner of prayers and ſupplications are to be made for all men, according to the ſignification of the ſeverall expreſſions, or termes, in which we are inſtructed to it, Supplications, Prayers, and Interceſſions; though alſo the ſeverall termes doe ſignifie the ſame things, and are oft put one for another, and oft put together, and the ſame expreſſions doubled for more vehement urging the matter exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to (as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 18.) yet there may alſo be conſidered ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſignification in the termes, for directing us what, and in what manner prayers are to be made for all men; and ſo firſt by Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Prayers, may be ſignified generally all thoſe petitions for good things for them, or in the behalfe of them, that may tend to their greateſt good, and thoſe to be made with humility, and being abaſed before him in the ſight and acknowledgement of our owne vileneſſe, and the ſinfulneſſe and iniquity of our ſelves and others, for whom good things are deſired, and yet with earneſtneſſe and boldneſſe, in review and acknowledgement of Gods great goodneſſe, and readineſſe to pardon, and doe us good; and eſpecially ſuch humble and earneſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning of good things for them, or in the behalfe of them, as are in order of Nature to be the firſt things in our prayers for them, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from and before thoſe ſignified diſtinctly by Interceſſions; which properly and diſtinctly note to us an appearing as a Third, or middle Perſon, for an offending Perſon to the party offended, and ſo direct us
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118359:23"/>
unto prayers or entreaties to be made, not onely in their behalfe, and for good things for them, but alſo more directly for ſome preſent favour, ſparing, or mercy in pardoning Iniquity, or rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing judgement, that might tend to their deſtruction or cutting off, to be at preſent conferred on them, according to their needs and capacities; The need of which Interceſſions, or ſtepping in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men, and for the obtaining forbearance, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of that nature directly for them, or to them, is occaſioned by their abuſe of the goodneſſe of God in anſwering the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Supplications and Prayers</hi> in providing ſo well, and doing things for them, about them, and in behalfe of them, that had ſuch reall tendencie to their good; for ſome more particular open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe diſtinct ſorts of praying, and the manner of their being for all men, we may put them into theſe two heads. Firſt, The petitioning of good things in the behalfe of them, that are not directly for them, or for mercies and bleſſings to be conferred on them, but for them in reſpect of their end or tendencie. Secondly, The intreating, ſupplicating, or making interceſſion directly for them, and for mercies and good things to be given to them, or conferred on them, according to their needs and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities.</p>
            <p>1 The petitioning of good things in the behalfe of them, that in reſpect of their end and tendency may be for the good of them, that yet are not directly for them, or for bleſſings to be perſonally conferred on them, that prayers of this ſort may be called prayers made for them, becauſe the end and tendencie of the things deſired are for the good of them; and ſo alſo the doing thoſe things deſired, are as teſtimonies of reſpect and love towards them, is like to that language of the Scripture, where Gods gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to <hi>Solomon</hi> great furniture of Wiſdome, and Bleſſing, and ſtrengthning him to the building an houſe to his name, is called, <hi>Great things done for David his ſervant, and for</hi> Iſrael <hi>his people, 1 King.</hi> 8. 66. And when <hi>Pauls</hi> ſufferings are ſaid to be for them, by whom or for whom they were not directly occaſioned, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. for they had never ſeen his face in the fleſh, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 1. becauſe the end and tendencie of his Miniſtration which occaſioned his ſufferings, and ſo the iſſue and fruit of them was for their good, and where the great works God did directly for his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to them in gathering them out of the lands, and preſerving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118359:23"/>
them out of their diſtreſſes in the Wilderneſſe, and leading them to a City of habitation, is called <hi>Gods great goodneſſe, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works towards, or for the children of men in general,</hi> becauſe the end and tendencie of his bleſſing, and cauſing the light of his countenance to ſhine upon them herein, was for the good of other people and Nations, <hi>That his way might be known upon earth, and his ſaving health among all Nations,</hi> Pſal. 107. 2. 8. with 67 1-3. and ſo alſo all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have cauſe to glorifie God for his great goodneſſe towards them, and wonderfull works for them, in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus Chriſt a Miniſter of the Circumciſion to confirm the promiſes of God made unto the Fathers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8, 9, 10. So thoſe <hi>Supplications and Prayers</hi> for good things, or for things that may have a good end and tendencie towards them, may be truly ſaid to be for them, in reſpect of that their end and tendencie, though not directly or in the firſt place for them, or for bleſſings to be given to, or conferred on them. Such are,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Thoſe Prayers that are directly made for others that live among them, and yet are diſtinguiſhed from the generality of all men, even all Saints, that are not of the world, but a people choſen out of the world, for their peculiar bleſſing, ſanctifying, and furniture to and in all their ſervice of Chriſt, and ſuffering for him in the world, which are ſuch bleſsings as they onely are capable of; The end of theſe things deſired directly for them according to their capacity, being for the preſerving and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to do good to others, <hi>That they may ſhine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life,</hi> Phil. 2. 15, 16. <hi>That men ſeeing their good works, may glorifie their Father,</hi> Mat. 5. 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. Theſe prayers are in the ſenſe firſt mentioned for <hi>all men;</hi> Though the things directly petitioned for, are not deſired ſo for them, as to be conferred upon them, they being not yet capable ſubjects thereof: Yet for as much as one main and great end of their being deſired to be conferred on the Saints as they are capable of receiving them, is for the good of others, theſe prayers, I ſay, in reſpect of their end and tendencie are for all men; Of this nature is that prayer of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. he ſaith, He doth not pray for the world, that is directly, and in the firſt place, in theſe Petitions, or for theſe Bleſsings to be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on them, they being not capable ſubjects of them; But for them that the Father had given him (through the prevalency of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118359:24"/>
heavenly Call) out of the world; not that they might be taken out of the world, but ſtill a ſeed or generation of them preſerved in the world, and therein kept from the evill of it, verſe 15. And that they might be ſanctified through the truth, to peculiar ſervice of him in the world, as he had ſent them into the world, even as the Father ſent him in reſpect of his Miniſtration, to be the light of the world, verſe 17, 18. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 14. And this not onely for the firſt Apoſtles, but alſo for all thoſe that ſhould after believe through their word, that they may be one with him and his Father, in their Deſign, love, and endeavour for the good of the world; All this, ſaith he, verſ. 21. 23. he prayes for, for them, That the world may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them, (namely, all ſuch as through grace receive this word) as thou haſt loved me; ſo that all theſe prayers in reſpect of their end and tendency were for all men; And with this agrees <hi>Pſal. 67. God be mercifull to us and bleſſe us, and cauſe the light of thy countenance to ſhine upon us; That thy way may be known upon earth, and thy ſaving health among all Nations.</hi> The firſt verſe we may take either as a prayer, eſpecially, and more peculiarly, for all the Iſrael of God, but then for all of them, not onely of the Jewes, but of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo, even all ſuch as in his calling are perſwaded to come to him, to receive him according to the manifeſtations afforded them, to know the grace of God in truth, in every Nation; for ſuch there are, even children of the Kingdome, as good ſeed ſown all over the world; And then compared with the next verſe, it inſtructs, that peculiar, and ſpecial particular bleſsings, as before, protections in, and preſervations from the evill of the world, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and furniture through his truth, according to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations given them, the light of his countenance ſhining upon them, in more abundant opening his glorious grace, as appearing in, or through his Son unto them; And in, and with all this, his mercifull pardoning and paſsing by their iniquities that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might keep theſe good things from them, they being of a higher nature, and deeper dye, than other mens ſinner. That theſe things are to be deſired and prayed for onely for the Iſrael of God, to be directly conferred upon them according to their needs and capacities. But to this end theſe prayers are to be prayed for them, that in Gods gracious anſwering, and ſo by them, as they are by Gods providence ſent to, or ſcattered among all Nations,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118359:24"/>
               <hi>His way may be known upon earth, and his ſaving health among all Nations,</hi> to the end that all men, even all the people, may praiſe him. Or,</p>
            <p>Secondly, we may take the firſt verſe as a Prayer generally for all <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, for the whole Nation, as a Nation to whom God had made known his Word, his Statutes, and Judgements, as he had not done to other Nations, and upon whom his Name was called, that by them it might be proclamed and known to other Nations; a Prayer for ſuch peculiar National bleſſings, protections, and Salvations among other Nations, and more abundant manifeſting himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, as a people called by his Name; but then in ſuch a ſenſe it was a prayer peculiarly and only for that Nation; ſo <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 23, 24, &amp;c. The bleſſing where-with the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to be bleſſed, and ſo compared with the next verſe, it inſtructs us, That peculiar or ſpecial, general or National bleſſings, ſuch as by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Nations they may be known, as a People whom God hath reſpect unto for his Name-ſake, are to be prayed for, for ſuch Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as upon which the name of God in Chriſt is called, that have his Word, Ordinances, and hold the profeſſion and acknowledgement of him (though too generally, not in truth, nor in righteouſneſſe) and ſo to be more abundantly, and eſpecially deſired, for, &amp; upon ſuch, as on whom his Name is more abundantly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or more rightly called; but to this end they are ſo to be prayed for, and bleſſed in his Name, that ſo by means of or through them, <hi>His way may be known upon earth, and his ſaving health among all Nations;</hi> to the end that al the people may praiſe him.</p>
            <p>And ſuch is that prayer of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 King. 8. 59, 60. which is much of the end and ſumme of all the former Petitions, that he may maintaine the cauſe of his Servant, and of his people Iſrael at all times; <hi>That all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God, and there is none elſe;</hi> which is that which being known by all, or any of the ends of the earth, wil move them to look to him, and be ſaved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 22. ſo that even theſe prayers for peculiar Nationall bleſſings, though directly only for thoſe Nations on whom his name is called, as wel as alſo thoſe fore-mentioned prayers for peculiar, particular, and perſonal bleſſings, though directly only for the Saints and Servants of God in the world, yet and upon a like account the one and the other are prayers made for all men, for as much as one maine and laſt end of the things deſired, and of the deſiring of them, is for the good of all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even for their beſt good. Of this nature are thoſe prayers for all Saints, exhorted to <hi>Eph. 6. 18, 19. Praying alwayes, with all prayer, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118359:25"/>
ſupplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſupplication for all Saints, and for me, that utterance may be given me</hi> (to what end?) <hi>that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the myſterie of the Goſpel;</hi> which is equivalent with this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>Paul</hi> being appointed and furniſhed a Herauld, or Cryer of this Meſſage to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he wils therefore that men pray every where (namely) that he and others, with, and after him, may be ever furniſhed to, preſerved, and bleſſed in this ſervice, for the good of all thoſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> amongſt whom they are ſent, And that this is the firſt ſort of Prayers, and firſt ſenſe in which prayers are to bee made for all men, that is meant in this text, alſo appears by the ſcope of the text as fore-conſidered.</p>
            <p>2 Thoſe prayers that are made directly againſt them (in their evil purpoſes, and wayes, againſt his Name, his Goſpel and people) or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome particular perſons, and whole Nations of them in ſuch their evil enterpriſes, are yet for them in reſpect of their end and tendencie, even for thoſe againſt whom directly they are made, and for the good of all men generally; ſuch prayers, as in which Gods Judgements, to the blaſting of them, and confounding them in their evil wayes, his breaking and croſſing them therein, his wrath, or the teſtimonies of his diſpleaſure to be teſtified againſt them, are earneſtly deſired, are yet in reſpect of their end and tendency, for their good, and the good of all, for as much as the end of the Judgements, and breakings deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt them, and ſo conſequently of ſuch deſires of them, is the ſealing home admonition, and inſtruction to them, that they may bee aſhamed, and turne from the evils reproved, and that others alſo may by Gods Judgements on them, and croſſing of them, learne to beware of ſuch evils. Of this nature thoſe prayers, and heavie imprecations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Families of <hi>Edom</hi> (in the firſt place) <hi>Moab, Iſhmael,</hi> &amp;c. and againſt all that joyned with them, in their conſultations againſt his people, <hi>Pſal. 83.

               <hi>Perſecute them with thy Tempeſts, make them afraid with thy Storme; fill their faces with ſhame</hi> (ver. 16.) <hi>that they,</hi> even thoſe very people, while thy hand is lifted up, and thy Judgements on them and the ſurvivors of them, in all the opportunities given them, <hi>may ſeek thy name, O Lord, Let them be confounded, and troubled for ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118359:25"/>
they, and all others, in whoſe ſight Gods Judgements are, may know that thou whoſe name alone is Jehovah, art the moſt high over all the earth (compare 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 60. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21-23.) that ſo the inhabitants of the world may learne righteouſneſſe, when his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are upon the earth; yet that the particular Perſons, Families, or Nations, on whom his hand is lifted up, may ſee, and pour out their Prayer when his chaſtening is upon them, according to the deſire and expectation of God, whence it is a note ſtil of greater wickedneſſe if they wil not doe ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 8, 9-11-16.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe, if we diligently conſider, and compare that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. (as alſo compared with the Scriptures fore-cited) with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 13. and that with <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4, 5. and <hi>Obadiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 35. &amp; 36. 1-7. where the execution of thoſe Judgements deſired againſt them in their evil purpoſes, and wayes, in that 83 <hi>Pſalme</hi> is denounced and threatned in <hi>Ezek. &amp; Obadi,</hi> and declared as done in <hi>Mal. 1. &amp; Rom.</hi> 9. we ſhal ſee clearly, that that hatred teſtified againſt the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Eſau,</hi> or <hi>Edom,</hi> in ſuch their evil wayes (in reſpect of the firſt end and tendency of it, in either the imprecations, or executions of it) was not tending to their eternal deſtruction (though to their periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ever in thoſe enterpriſes, and that there might be none remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Family or Kingdome in that ſtate and poſture, in which they had ſome power, and opportunity for accompliſhing their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 17. with <hi>Ezek. 35. 9.

But on the other hand, that they and the reſidue of the Heathen might be aſhamed, and ſeek the Lord, &amp;c. compare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 16-18. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 35. 9-12. &amp; 36. 7. And to the ſame end alſo after God had thus teſtified his diſpleaſure, and executed his hatred againſt them in their evil wayes, he ſo raiſed up Saviours on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours with termes of Peace by the Goſpel, as coming from Chriſt exalted, to <hi>Edom</hi> and all the Heathen, that now they might be judged in righteouſneſſe according to that Goſpel, by which therefore he firſt admoniſhed them all, and in every place to repentance, <hi>Obad.</hi> 21. with <hi>Act.</hi> 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 30, 31. and therefore did he raiſe up the tabernacles of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> in the Diſpenſation of Chriſt, in and by his Apoſtles, that they might poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Likewiſe thoſe more grievous imprecations, prayers for, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Judgements of a higher and worſe nature upon the houſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> the beloved people, as conſidered in their evil purpoſes, and wayes, againſt the more plentiful meanes and grace afforded them, that were executed in the beginnings of them, in and at the time of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> Captivity, and more fully, when their ſinne was grown ful, in the rejecting of the Goſpel, in and at the time of the deſtruction of their place and Nation by the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was prayed for, and threatned againſt them, (they perſiſting in, and going on farther to contract, and commit thoſe iniquities againſt which they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced) <hi>Pſal. 69. 22, 23, 24, 25. &amp; Iſa.</hi> 6. 9-11. 13. &amp; 29. 10. In which God is ſaid, for their great ungodlineſſe (as before concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Edom,</hi> ſo in theſe Judgements on his peculiar people) to hate his heritage, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 8. to abhor the excellency of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hate his Palaces, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 8. concerning this the Apoſtle propounds the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 11. telling us, That now the generality of that people or Nation (before ſo peculiarly loved) even all that were not choſen, and pulled out from having fellowſhip with the reſt in that rejection of Chriſt at ſo high a rate, through the grace of God proclaimed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto them all to that purpoſe, they, even all the reſidue, were now given up to that fearful blindneſſe and Judgement, according to thoſe Propheſies, and to thoſe Prayers, or Imprecations of <hi>David</hi> fore-cited, to which he alludes; his Queſtion concerning them upon this Declaration is, <hi>Have they ſtumbled, hath God given them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to this in part</hi> (for it was not yet in full, as verſ. 25. then indeed there wil be no remedy, but hath God done this even in theſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Judgements of Reprobation) and that accotding to thoſe imprecations in <hi>David,</hi> hath God done it to this end (and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was this the firſt end or intention of <hi>David,</hi> in making ſuch interceſſion againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi>) that they ſhould fall? Did God intend in theſe beginnings of ſuch fearefull Judgements, or did <hi>David</hi> intend in praying for them, or therein deſire their eternal and everlaſting deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by them? And in anſwer to this queſtion he ſaith; <hi>God forbid, farre be it from us to entertaine ſuch a thought;</hi> but on the other hand, God hath ſuffered them in part to fall, and through their fall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the bringing Salvation to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the end of both is, to provoke them to jealouſie, to admoniſh them to be jealous of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118359:26"/>
ſelves, and their wayes, and bethink themſelves of the Grace they had ſinned againſt, that ſo they might not abide in their unbelief; and therefore the Apoſtle knowing the cordialneſſe of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, being one with him in his deſigne, did ſtrive, if by any means he might provoke them to emulation, that he might be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſaving ſome of them, verſe 14. His hearts deſire and prayer to God for whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> (now in part rejected) being, that they might be ſaved, Chap. 10. 1. So that prayer againſt the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 6. breathed forth alſo by <hi>Jer.</hi> Chap. 10. 25. That God would poure out his wrath upon them, &amp;c. (namely in their Rebellious enterprizes, and lifting up themſelves againſt his name and people) For they, ſaith the Text in both places, have devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jacob,</hi> and made him deſolate, yet the firſt end and tendencie of theſe prayers, ſo directly againſt them in their evill wayes, were for their good, conſidering that (as we aforeſhewed in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.) for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be preſerved among the heathen, and defended from their rage and malice, ſeeing it was to this end, <hi>That by them his way might be known upon earth, and his ſaving health among all Nations,</hi> was of all mercies, the moſt conducing to their good; Therefore in the poſture they were in, there could be no better prayer for the generality of them, than for God to poure out his wrath upon them, in revenging the bloud of his ſervants, and ſo blaſting and breaking their enterprizes, that his people might yet be preſerved amongſt them; though in theſe judgements many of the heathen might be ſuddenly deſtroyed and ſnatched away, yet even thoſe might receive admonition, and reproof from God, who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe was not wanting in giving it in due time while it might be for their good, even while his judgements were on them to the deſtroying them from the earth, if they had not ſo long provoked him before by their rebellions, that he had wholly rejected them.</p>
            <p>And however the ſnatching away ſome in their ſtubbornneſſe and rebellion, ſo as Gods hand might be ſeen in it for his names ſake, was much conducing; and therefore oft uſed by God as a gracious inſtrument to the general admonition and good of all the ſurviving enemies, as <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 1-6. That they might ſee and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly, leſt they alſo periſh in like manner; Therefore alſo is this prayer of <hi>David</hi> in the following verſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in ſuch termes; See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 10. (equivalent with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 16, 17.) <hi>Let God be known among the heathen, in our ſight, by reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

&amp;c.</hi> and ſo the firſt and direct end of theſe prayers, verſe 13. is, that <hi>his people, and the ſheep of his paſture, may give him thanks, and praiſe him to all generations;</hi> which is for this cauſe that the Gentiles may glorifie God for his mercy, and come in and laud him with them, compare herewith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8, 9, 10. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67. So that even theſe prayers, in reſpect of their end, and tendencie, were for the heathen, againſt whom directly they were made. And in ſuch manner are theſe prayers to be made for <hi>all men.</hi> But</p>
            <p>2 There are alſo Intreaties, <hi>Supplications and Interceſsions</hi> to be made more directly for <hi>all men,</hi> even for mercies, favours, and good things to be conferred on them, according to their needs and capacities; And ſuch as may conduce to the great Deſign of God, and his people, for their good, and thoſe ſuch as may be more directly and properly ſignified by <hi>Interceſsions. Prayers</hi> are to be made for <hi>all men,</hi> for Gods gracious extenſion of ſuch pardon of their iniquities, in which they ill requite, rebell, and ſin againſt the grace of God bringing ſalvation to them all in the means fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and ſo in all mercies, and chaſtiſements, that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments tending to their utter cutting off, may yet be kept off through the mediation of Chriſt, and for his ſake, that it may not be ſpeedily executed, but liberty, occaſion, and opportunity yet put in their hands to enjoy the mercies of God that may lead them to repentance, and to repent and turn to him, as we have noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <hi>Stephen</hi> at his laſt breathing kneeled down, and cryed with a loud voice, <hi>Father forgive them, or do not lay this ſin to their charge,</hi> to execute judgement ſpeedily, but give them time yet againe to repent, that in repenting they may receive forgiveneſſe of ſins, and inheritance. So the Apoſtle generally inſtructs us, <hi>If any man ſee his brother ſin a ſin not unto death, he ſhall pray, and God ſhall give give him life;</hi> ſuch pardon of the ſin to the ſinner as that judgement be not executed, he not be cut off, but breathing-time afforded that he might repent; and in owning his ſin as grace diſcovers, and reproves, in repenting and turning to him, he ſhall give him life in a further ſenſe; the cleanſing of the conſcience, and healing of the nature, peace with God through our Lord Jeſus, and hope of the glory to be revealed; neither are prayers to be made for them otherwiſe, or on other termes, and if we pray according to his will, we know he heareth us; But on thoſe termes, according to mens need and capacity, and as the Goſpel inſtructeth, we are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118359:27"/>
in prayer, not to ceaſe to pray for them. Though God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many times in ſuch caſes, even when judgements have been prepared for them, graciouſly delivered them, and not ſtirred up all his wrath againſt them, and in ſuch a ſenſe forgiven their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 38. not laid it yet to their charge, that they might turne to him and be healed; yet they are ſinning ſtill to provoke him to anger, and hardening their hearts againſt his goodneſſe that leadeth them to repentance; yet ſtill prayers are to be made for them, and with ſo much the more earneſtneſſe, while it may be in due time, God yet giving opportunity, not having utterly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them; That forbearance may yet be granted, That God may yet wait to be gracious, and not yet cut them up for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe, and unfruitfulneſſe, as in that Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 6-9. our Saviours example inſtructeth us, and alſo in his praying for thoſe that added that to all their former iniquities of abuſing the former ſervants they crucified him that was the Heir, <hi>Yet Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them,</hi> and by his Spirit leading <hi>Stephen,</hi> after they had added yet more iniquity to iniquity, ſtill to intercede for pardon, and ſo he inſtructeth us, <hi>To pray for them that perſecute us, Bleſſe them that curſe us,</hi> in ſuch manner, and for ſuch things, as in which we may be one in Gods Deſign, and render our ſelves like him, who gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, through the Mediation of his Son, extends ſuch forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and longſuffering, and to ſuch ends, That he ſtill cauſeth his Sunne to ſhine, and his Rain to fall, and therein is really piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and kind to the unthankfull and evill, witneſſing his goodneſſe to lead them to repentance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 45, 46. <hi>Luke 6. 35, 36. Act. 14. 17. Rom.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations of what the prayers are, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all prayers are to be made for <hi>all men,</hi> may afford us ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in our prayers, to pray as we ought, which the holy Spirit teacheth, as he doth all other things, by opening the Teſtimony of Jeſus, and ſhewing the things, of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13, 14. As therein he preſents us with good ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prayer (as we ſhall after ſhew) ſo thereby he inſtructeth us what to pray for, and in what manner for all men, and how to pray as we ought for every man, in teaching us to pray, according to his will, as declared in that declaration of his name in his Son, for ſuch things as the Father hath appointed him to give unto men, by vertue of his Sacrifice and Mediation, to each according
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118359:28"/>
to his need and capacity, and ſo as according to the wiſdome of God may be for his good; and ſo we are here directed, not to pray for thoſe peculiar bleſſings, which men become capable and meet ſubjects to partake of onely in beleeving and comming to Chriſt, as <hi>Col. 1. 9-13. 1 Pet. 2. 3, 4.</hi> ſuch as ſanctifying and furniture to, and bleſſing in the miniſtration of the Goſpel, and the like for any that is yet in the ſtate, fellowſhip, and way of the world, and ſo of it, yet to pray for theſe things for all Saints, that the world may be the better for them, as to the beſt good, <hi>Job.</hi> 17. 9-21, 23. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we pray for Gods proſpering any man in his evill way, or for ſpecial National protections, ownings, and ſalvations, to be afforded to any people or Nation openly ſet in oppoſition to him, or to any people that are called by his name, and eſpecially if for his names ſake called upon them; But we are to ſuffer the grace of God to teach and lead us, as it certainly will, to pray againſt their evill works and inventions, and ſo againſt them as abiding in the ſaid wayes, and for ſpecial protections, ownings, and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be afforded to that people or Nation upon whom his name is called, or that do more rightly worſhip and acknowledge him, and that for his names ſake, and both theſe intentionally for the good, not only of thoſe people for whom the prayers are directly made, but of their enemies alſo, and ſo of <hi>all men.</hi> Our Saviours Admonition and Inſtruction to his Diſciples, when upon ſome peoples unthankfulneſſe, and not receiving him, they would have prayed for fire to come down from heaven and conſume them, as <hi>Elias</hi> did, may here ſeaſonably be conſidered by us, <hi>Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of, for the Son of man came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them,</hi> Luke 9. 55, 56. And therefore alſo, Though we are not, nor is it according to his will, to pray for forgiveneſſe, peace, and joy, in a full and proper ſenſe, to be given to any man abiding in his evill way, or in his natural ſtate and condition, yet we may, and are taught by his grace, to pray for ſuch pardon, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and renewing of goodneſſe to be conferred on them, and in due time, as may give them opportunity, and have tendency, and efficacy in it, to lead them to repentance, <hi>That ſo they may receive forgiveneſſe of ſins, and inheritance with thoſe that are ſanctified by ſaith that is in Chriſt. And ſo the end of all prayers for all men, is, that they might be ſaved.</hi> We come next to conſider,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>What are thoſe thanksgivings joyned with prayers to be made
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118359:28"/>
for all men.</hi> This the Scripture plentifully ſets before us, That al manner of right prayer, is joyned with <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> Phil. 4. 6. <hi>In every thing by prayer and ſupplication with thanksgiving, let your requeſts be made known to God.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 14, 15. and 95. 2. <hi>Come into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with Thankſgiving, offer ſacrifice of Thanksgiving, and call upon him:</hi> Yea all men are invited ſo to do. Now what this <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> is, that is ſo inſeparably joyned with all right praying, we ſhall alſo finde in thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak to this matter, that it is ſuch a commemoration and thankful acknowledgement of, and bleſſing God for, his great love and mercy teſtified in what he hath already done for us, as in which Gods goodneſſe is only commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and glorified (and not ours with it, as in that of the Phariſee, <hi>God I thank thee that I am not &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 18. 11.) and that ſo, as in the minding and conſideration thereof, we have incouragement pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, to expect, and pray in faith for thoſe further ſtreamings forth of mercy, and good things, according to our needs and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which through the knowledge of his name we are lead to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and ask accordingly to his wil. So our Savior teacheth us in that doctrine of <hi>Prayer, Mat.</hi> 6. 9. to acknowledge and commemorate the honor and praiſe due to his name, for what he hath done in, and by his Son, in the forefront of all the Petitions we ask of him, that therein we may glorifie him, and yeeld him the praiſe of his grace, who alſo for his names ſake meeteth with him that rejoyceth in acknowledging it, <hi>Though to us belong nothing but ſhame,</hi> that therein alſo we may be minded of that which may inlarge and draw out our hearts with encouragement in God, though abaſement in our ſelves further to pray according to his will. And ſo the holy Spirit for the helping of our infirmities, &amp; teaching us how to pray as we ought, as he takes of the things of Jeſus, and ſheweth (as is ſhewed before) ſo therein he glorifies him, in, and according to the Goſpel, minding us what cauſe of <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> we have to God, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by and in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and how that ſerves for our inſtruction, and encouragement further to pray; ſee examples and inſtructions to this. And firſt in thoſe Thankſgivings that are joyned with Prayers made for all Saints, and for ſuch peculiar bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to be conferred on them, as of which they only are capable ſubjects, though in reſpect of their end and tendencie theſe are alſo for all men, as afore is ſhewed: In all theſe Thankſgivings, there is not only an acknowledgement of that true in Chriſt for men as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118359:29"/>
the bottom cauſe of all thankſgivings, and of the great love &amp; goodneſſe of God to manward, as manifeſted therein; but with this there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes an acknowledgement, and commemoration of Gods great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in thoſe ſpecial ſtreamings forth of the iſſues and ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ues of that Redemption, and grace of God in Chriſt to manward, which they have met with, and through his grace have had efficacie in them, to the ſaving them, and making them meet to partake of the inheritance of the Saints, in thoſe peculiar bleſſings deſired and prayed for, for them; See our Saviours Prayer, <hi>Joh. 17. 7, 8. Now they have known ſaith he, that all things what ſoever thou haſt given me are of thee, for I have given them the words thou gaveſt me, and they have known ſurely that I came out from thee; I pray for them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>namely, that the peculiar bleſſings, of which they through the prevalency of the grace of God are made capable ſubjects, may be conferred on them. I pray not</hi> (namely) <hi>this Prayer, theſe Petitions, and in this manner for the world, for whom yet he was ſent a Saviour,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 14. <hi>and that not to condemn them, but that through him they might be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He doth not make this Prayer, and in this manner, for all for whom he dyed, and gave himſelfe a ranſome, nor for any of them, until by the prevalency of the grace of God upon them they be given him out of the world, and ſo there is that as a peculiar matter of thankſgiving alſo to be made for them. So <hi>Col. 1. 8-12. Since the day</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that we heard of your love in the Spirit, wee ceaſe not to pray, that yee might be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wiſdome, and ſpiritual understanding,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance, which knowing, we make our requeſts for the conferring of ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar bleſſings as therein you are made capable ſubjects of with joy,</hi> as <hi>Phil. 1. 3, 4-9, 10. 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 4, 5. This gives us occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to conſider as the ground and reaſon of it, that it was not the end or intention of God in ſending his Son into the world, the Saviour of the world, appointing him by the grace of God to taſt Death for every man, and exalting him by vertue of his ſufferings, a Prince, and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; nor is it his mind, or wil, according to which all Prayers are to be made, that having done that in and by his Son for them, his Son ſhould therefore neceſſarily give eternal Life to all of them for whom he dyed, and is become ſuch a Saviour, or to any of them in their particulars, while remaining in their Natural ſtate and condition, but only to thoſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118359:29"/>
that through grace according to the diſcoveries of him vouchſafed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him; 'Tis true, <hi>he was made ſin for us, that we might bee made the righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> not that all for whom he was made ſin muſt neceſſarily be thereupon made the righteouſneſs of God, but that they might be made ſo in and through him, and ſo thoſe only of all for whom he was made ſin; that by faith of the opperation of God come in to him, are therein, and ſo in him to be made the righteouſneſs of God 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. our Saviour therefore, as the reaſon of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch manner, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. namely, for ſuch peculiar bleſſings to be conferred only on ſuch perſons as for whom there was ſuch peculiar matter of Thankſgiving to be made as before, he firſt layes down this Doctrin, ver. 2. That the Father hath given him power over all fleſh, (not only over all Creatures for adminiſtation of the Government of God amongſt men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. but alſo over all Mankind, as a Prince and Saviour for them) That he ſhould give eternal Life (he ſaith not to all Fleſh, or to all Men who are given to him, and committed to his diſpoſe and judgement by vertue of his ſufferings) but to as many as the Father hath given him; where the Fathers giving is evidently to be underſtood in a ſenſe peculiar, and diſtinct from that ſenſe of his gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, after which it is ſaid, That in giving him power over all fleſh, or committing the whole diſpoſe and judgement of all men to him, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22. he hath therein given and delivered over all men, even all the ends of the earth, and all things into his hands, as his proper inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, by vertue of his ſufferings, <hi>Pſal. 2. 6. 8.

The Fathers giving all men to him in this ſenſe, and to this end as the firſt end towards All, is evidently ſignified in the firſt part of the verſe, <hi>The Father hath given him power over all fleſh,</hi> as is ſeen by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with other Scriptures; therefore ſeeing he diſtinguiſheth from theſe ſome perſons that the Father hath given him, he muſt needs mean in a peculiar ſenſe of giving, ſo as all given him, and into his diſpoſe, by vertue of his ſuffering for them, that through him they might be ſaved, yet are not ſo given him, even a giving by an actual Election, or choyſe out from the reſidue of all Fleſh, into his ſpecial charge, and protection, and ſo explicated, ver. 9. with <hi>Joh. 15. 19.

way, fellowſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> through the prevailing force of the grace of God in Chriſt to Man-ward, diſcerned, and believed by them; It is the will of the Father concerning Chriſt, and the ends and vertues of his coming down from heaven, and now being inveſted with all power, <hi>That he ſhould give eternal life to ſuch,</hi> according to that, <hi>Joh. 6. 39. 40. It is the will of him that ſent him,</hi> that he might be impowred to accompliſh which he firſt came down from heaven, <hi>That of all that he hath given him</hi> (not out of others, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 2. 9. but in a general and large ſenſe without diſtinguiſhing or oppoſing them to other things or perſons, <hi>All whatſoever the Father hath given him) he ſhould loſe nothing, but raiſe it up at the laſt day.</hi> Now when he ſpeaks in ſuch a ful ſenſe without limitation or diſtinguiſhing from, &amp; oppoſing to other things, or other ſenſes of giving, we can by no means exclude any thing that is in any ſenſe given him, according to the Apoſtles reaſoning, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27. Now all perſons and things being given and delivered to him, as we ſhewed before, <hi>Its the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will he ſhould loſe nothing,</hi> but in the iſſue bring all to him, <hi>Raiſing it up at the laſt day;</hi> The Glory, Kingdome, Dominion, though now men detract much of it from him, and by reaſon of ſin, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is yet ſubject to the bondage of corruption; yet it ſhall all arrive at him, <hi>and be ſhall raiſe it up at the laſt day, when every knee ſhall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and every tongue confeſſe, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo neither ſhall he loſe any of thoſe perſons redeemed by him, though many of them loſe and bring deſtruction upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by denying him that bought them, yet they ſhall not be loſt to him, <hi>But he ſhall raiſe them up at the laſt day,</hi> and bring them to his judgement ſeat, as verſe 37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me,</hi> even ſuch as now will not come to him that they might have life, though graciouſly drawn by the Father, as verſ. 35, 36. Them will he bring to be ſlain for ever before his face, becauſe they would not that he ſhould reign over them, who is their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lord, and unto whom they were all given, that through him they might have been ſaved.</p>
            <p>But then it follows as another part of the Fathers will concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, <hi>That whoſoever ſeeth the Son, and believeth in him,</hi> or as v. 37. <hi>he that cometh to him,</hi> ſpeaking in the preſent tenſe, for as the ſame verſe ſaith, <hi>All ſhall come, either here, or hereafter;</hi> but he that now in this day of Gods grace and patience, <hi>cometh in the Fathers draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> which anſwers the Fathers giving to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 2. or at

leaſt is that in which they are made capable ſubjects of ſuch giving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is the will of the Father concerning Chriſt that he ſhould give unto ſuch eternal life; <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son</hi> (the Saviour of it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14.) That whoſoever of the world ſo loved by him, and to whom love is ſo teſtified in, and through the Son; doth through this grace beleeve in him (implying that all ſo loved by him, do not ſo anſwer his love again) <hi>that they ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſuch prayers for the peculiar bleſſings of eternal life to be conferred on perſons, are only to be prayed for; for thoſe on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of whom there is alſo ſuch peculiar matter of Thankſgivings to be made; And ſuch and of like nature, are thoſe Thankſgivings to be joyned with prayers of the firſt ſort, as already mentioned, and is to be ſeen in the Scriptures quoted; and although in them there be many things acknowledged and commemorated to Gods glory, and for our encouragement to pray thoſe prayers unto him, which are peculiar priviledges of the Saints, for whom ſuch further things are directly deſired, as they only are capable of, yet for as much as thoſe peculiar mercies acknowledged, as well as thoſe deſired, are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their end, and tendency for the good of all men, as we ſee in that example of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 18, 21, 23. and thoſe of like nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 1, 2. &amp;c. &amp; 56. 9-13 &amp; 116. 16-18. even theſe Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings alſo, in a like ſenſe, as the prayers of this ſort forementioned, may be truly ſaid to be made for all men. According to that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh. 11. 41, 42. Father I thanke thee that thou haſt heard me; And I know that thou heareſt me alwayes, but becauſe of the people that ſtand by I ſaid it, That they may believe that thou haſt ſent me;</hi> Therefore his praiſe is of him in the great Congregation, becauſe of Gods furniſhing, and upholding, and hearing him for their good, <hi>Pſal. 22. 22, 25.

All; A Teſtimony in due time:</hi> This being true and cordially done, and the ends and vertues of this with the Father, is the only cauſe and reaſon, <hi>That with him, in, and through him, he gives all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to life and godlineſſe,</hi> Rom. 8. 32. with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1, 3. So as whoſoever believeth in him, and ſo receiveth and cloſeth with him in the knowledge and faith of what he hath done, and is become for all men, and the love of God in him to Man-ward, doth therein receive, and is made capable of further receiving that eternall life in him by faith of it in him for them, and with him to be given them, and ſo in a firſt fruits of ſpirituall enjoyment, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. and 1. 12. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6-11. Therefore this is made the bottome matter of all the Thankſgiving, and acknowledgement, as being the foundation root, and cauſe of all the reſt, <hi>Col. 1. 14.

            <p>There is great Thankſgiving to be made directly for <hi>all men</hi> to the glory and praiſe of God, and the incouragement of his people to pray in faith for thoſe good things in their behalf, and for the good of them, and for good things to be directly beſtowed on them according to their needs and capacities, that may tend to

the furtherance of the great Deſigne of God for the good of <hi>all men:</hi> And that not onely for the great love of God in the gift of his Son, and the redemption wrought in him for them; But alſo for all thoſe mercies and accommodations of the naturall life, means leading to repentance and forbearance hitherto extended, and his good Spirit accompanying the ſame, inlightning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, &amp;c.

And received gifts in the man, and for men (as we may take it in both readings) <hi>even for the Rebellious,</hi> yea for ſuch as perſiſting in their Rebellions againſt this grace of God <hi>That brings ſalvation to all men, denying him that bought them, Do after bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> as appears by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring theſe 18. and 19. verſes, with verſe 21. yet for them the preſent and firſt end of his working Redemption, deſtroying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans works, and receiving gifts in himſelf for them, is, That now they might dwell with the Lord, and ſo that miſery and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which they after bring on themſelves, might in time be prevented to them; And therefore it follows farther in the Thankſgiving or acknowledgement of what God hath further done to that end; and of that as iſſuing out of the bowels of the former, and being nothing elſe but a ſtreaming forth of the ends and vertues thereof. Bleſſed be the Lord God in Chriſt, That now on the account of his having aſcended and received gifts, daily loadeth us; <hi>The God of our ſalvations, Selah.</hi> He that is thus our God, and a God of ſuch ſalvations to us in and through his Son; he is the God of ſalvation in a more generall latitude; The Saviour of all men, eſpecially of them that believe; And therefore we are inſtructed to give thanks alwayes, and for all things in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 20. yea the Apoſtle exhorting us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that which is good, both among our ſelves, and towards all men, directs us in purſuance hereof to <hi>Rejoyce evermore, to pray without ceaſing, and in every thing give thanks, For this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118359:32"/>
the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus concerning you,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 15, 16-18. And ſo here in purſuance of the great Deſign forementioned, <hi>To pray with Thanksgiving for all men;</hi> There is not a man to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, for whom there is not Thankſgiving to be made to God in his behalf, and that in the name of Chriſt, nor any thing to be prayed for, for any man, for our encouragement, to which, we have not ſomthing ſuitable in, and by Chriſt, for, and towards that man to give thanks for. And this leads us to conſider,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The ground or account upon which <hi>Prayers and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings are to be made for all men;</hi> And that is no other, but the truth and verity of that which we have already mentioned, as the bottome cauſe, and occaſion of Thankſgiving which we have to God, in and by Chriſt for them; See for this the following verſes, as joyned with this firſt, and ſo the word therefore verſe 1. though as it refers to the end of the exhortation, and thing exhorted to, it points to the foregoing Chapter, as we have ſeen; yet as it hath reference to the ground of the exhortation, or things exhorted to; ſo it leads us to the following verſes for finding out and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it, as will appear by conſidering them. <hi>I exhort therefore that Prayers, and Thanksgivings be made for all men, &amp;c. For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth; For one God, or God is one</hi> (as <hi>Gal. 3. 20. And there is one Mediator between God and men, The Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſome for All, a Teſtimony, or to be teſtified in due time, whereunto I am ordained a Preacher, and an Apoſtle, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. I will therefore that men pray every where, &amp;c.</hi> The ground of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all men, is here cleerly rendred by the Apoſtle, <hi>To be.</hi> The verity, and certainty of the love and good will of God to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to all men as manifeſted in that great Witneſſe and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof in that done in, and by Chriſt for them; As it is a general ground and rule of all right prayer that is according to his will, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14. For our better underſtanding this, and how it gives good ground of Prayers, and Thankſgivings to be made for all men, and that without wrath, or doubting. Let us take a briefe view of the words; See verſe 4. <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Some underſtand this as a Declaration of Gods abſolute will concerning Chriſt, and what ſhould certainly be accompliſhed by him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:118359:32"/>Firſt, That he ſhould ſave all men, with ſuch ſalvation, as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runs the knowledge of the truth, yea in reſpect of the greateſt work of it, ſuch as foreruns their being called to it, as 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. He hath ſaved us, and called us;</hi> That is, firſt Work ſalvation in himſelf for them, and ſo ſave, or recover the whole nature in himſelf as the publick Perſon. And ſecondly, that in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Gods Government, by vertue of what he hath done, and is perfect in him for them, he ſhould ſave them, and ſo they ſhould be preſerved by him, as they came to have beings given and continued here) to the comfortable enjoyment of the naturall life, the mercies, and accommodations thereof, and ſo from periſhing in, or under the ſhadows of the firſt Death. Thirdly, That he ſhould procure, and extend forbearance of ſins, committed againſt the light, and grace of Redemption, and fruits thereof, ſave, or keep from Judgements, that being ſpeedily executed, might cut off for ever, That ſo they may yet enjoy him a Teſtimony in due time to them; And ſo he is the Saviour of <hi>All men,</hi> according to the will of his Father concerning him. And Secondly, That he ſhould bring them all to the knowledge of the truth, either now in this day while it might be to their everlaſting comfort, or elſe hereafter, if here they wilfully reject till they be rejected of him, when it will be to their everlaſting terror, <hi>Iſa. 45. 23. Phil</hi> 2. 8, 9. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 5, 6, &amp;c. And ſo the will of God concerning what he was to do that men might be ſaved, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording good and large ground to pray for them; and the terror appearing in that which ſhal after be accompliſhed to their wo if now his grace be rejected affording motive to preſſe to earneſtneſs in praying and beſeeching both them, and God for them, while it is an accepted time. Now all theſe inſtructions ariſing from ſuch a reading of the words are true, and ſuitable to thoſe which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear fully in the following words. But here this verſe, ſeems more properly to be read, as a Declaration of Gods good will, love, and deſire towards men, and concerning them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as conſidered in their faln, loſt, and ſinfull eſtate, which was ſuch, as in which he would have them ſaved out of it, and brought back again to him; Such his great compaſſions, ſlowneſſe to anger, and riches in mercie, That he had no pleaſure in their deſtruction, but that they ſhould turn and live. And therefore deſired they ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth of his love and goodneſſe towards them that ſo they might be drawn into love of him, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118359:33"/>
to him, that were ſo full of hatred, and antipathy againſt him. And then as a real demonſtration of this his love, &amp; deſire for them and declaration of the way and means prepared that this might be (for though God loved them, and deſired their good, yet they could have enjoyed no ſtreamings forth, or manifeſtations of it, or benefit by it. If he had not deviſed means that his baniſhed might not be expelled, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 14.) He further tells us, That God is one, and unchangeable in all his holy Attributes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in love to man, as his creature, and the end of his other creation, and while he was not yet become wholly one with, and of Satan, that had tempted and prevailed over him, could not yet give him up; And ſo in holineſſe and truth, and therefore could by no means in clearing, clear the guilty, or forgive ſin without a fulfilling of his truth, and ſatisfying of his Juſtice; And ſo likewiſe in infinit wiſdome and goodneſſe in all, and therefore knew how to finde out a way of recovery that mercy and truth might meet together for mans recovery and helpfulneſſe in this loſt condition (as well as to make him of nothing a creature to ſuch excellent glory, and hath done it, <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe:</hi> And that appears in this that follows, <hi>There is one Mediator of God and man, and ſo between God and man, Chriſt Jeſus; A Mediator is not a Mediator of one; But God is one,</hi> Gal. 3. 20. A Mediator is of, and between two parties at a diſtance, and ſo is ours; But whereas the uſuall work of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators between man and man, is to lay his hand on both, and prevail with one to abate ſomething, and the other to pay or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie ſomething; ſo is not ours, for God is one, He was not turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemy, but loved us when we were enemies, ſo as he ſent the Mediator, He is one, and ſo infinit and perfect in holineſſe, and can abate nothing of what his Truth and Juſtice requires, and therefore muſt have full and perfect ſatisfaction, though we are ſo weak we can make none; The work therefore of our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is to make full ſatisfaction, pay the full price, come up to Gods terms; and then to bring us up to, and inable us to accept of thoſe termes in him made, and accepted for us; And ſo in the whole, and in each part of his work, That with God, and that with men, It is to reconcile man to God; The firſt in, and by himſelfe without them, The ſecond in their particular perſons through him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21. And for the accompliſhing this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:118359:33"/>
He that is the one Mediator of God and man, and that he might be a ſtanding Mediator between them; <hi>Gave himſelfe a ranſome for all men; A Teſtimony, or to be testified in due time, That ſo through him they might come to the knowledge of the truth, and be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For underſtanding the large ground of praying for <hi>All men,</hi> here ſet before us, conſider ſome of the particular inſtructions herein preſented.</p>
            <p>1 That Jeſus Chriſt by the will and appointment of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given himſelfe, and is accepted <hi>A Ranſome for All.</hi> 2 That he is by vertue hereof become a ſtanding and powerfull Mediator between God and men. 3 That by vertue, and by means of his Ranſome accepted, and his Mediation continually made for them, he is of the Father to them, <hi>A Teſtimony in due time, That they might come to the knowledge of the truth and be ſaved.</hi> And in all this, <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, That Jeſus Chriſt by the appointment of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath given himſelf, and is accepted a Ranſome for All, a price of Redemption, ſo as he hath redeemed and bought them All, as hath been ſhewed already, as to the perſons for whom now we ſhall apply our ſelves to the conſideration of the worke herein done for them.</p>
            <p>And ſo firſt, he hath in and by himſelfe redeemed them from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He hath by that his one offering for all, perfected through ſuffering, and now preſented to the Father, obtained and received into himſelf eternal redemption, a full and perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and Reſtoration of all that loſſe contracted by ſinne as charged on them by the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. 15.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt hath in, and by himſelf redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. where that he ſpeaks not of that redeeming the heart and conſcience from under the bondage and accuſation of ſin by the Law, which is only wrought in the ſpirit of the beleever, through the diſcovery of that done in Chriſt for all men; but of that done, namely of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought in Chriſt for them before they knew it This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in that he ſaith, the Redemption here ſpoke of was done, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, by his being made a curſe for us; whereas the other, though done by vertue thereof, yet is not effected, but through the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereof, and in the receit by faith (as before) yea it is ſtill more evident, in that he mentions this as perfectly done, that means might be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118359:34"/>
uſed for the doing the other, namely, the redeeming men in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, and that that might be wrought or received through faith. <hi>He hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, that the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the preaching of peace by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (Eph. 2. 14. 17. &amp; 3. 6.) <hi>might come on the Gentiles, that we</hi> (namely whoever beleeveth) <hi>might receive the promiſe of the Spirit through faith;</hi> according to that, <hi>Joh. 3. 16. God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son</hi> (namely, the Saviour of the world, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 14.) that whoever of the world ſo loved by him, through this grace beleeveth in him whom he hath ſent, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life;</hi> and ſo that, <hi>Gal</hi> 3. 13. is opened, <hi>Gal</hi> 4. 4, 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the query is fully anſwered, who they are encluded under the word <hi>us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. <hi>that he hath redeemed from the curſe of the Law, God ſent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeeme them that were under the Law, that we</hi> (there the perſon is changed) namely, <hi>whoever beleeveth might receive the adoption of children;</hi> but that done in Chriſt that this might be done, was done for all them that were under the Law, and who thoſe are, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. though under it as a teſtament all Covenant, were only all <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, yet under the condemnation penalty and curſe of it, and ſo by it declared and concluded were all the world, for what the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law, that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>By one man ſinne entred into the world, and Death by Sinne, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. Compare that with ver. 18. As the diſobedience of one was unto, or upon all in the firſt publique man to condemnation, ſo the righteouſnneſſe of one is unto, or upon all in the ſecond publique man, unto juſtification of life, his one righteouſneſſe hath ſo prevailed with the Father, that he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the nature and roome of all (That <hi>one dyed for all,</hi> is accepted with the Father as if all had dyed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14.) that they might live; and to that end live, that after this Grace appeares, they might not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him that dyed for them, and roſe againe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
            <p>So that in Jeſus the ſecond publick Perſon, the whole nature is delivered from the firſt condemnation and judgement; The truth and verity of which is proved in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. from this reaſon, <hi>For as by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners</hi> (namely in their particular perſons) and that is ſo many as ever came to have being from him, even from the beginning, verſe 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118359:34"/>
which fully ſhews, That that offence, was unto, or upon the whole nature in him as the publick Man to condemnation, before any of the individuals had their particular beings from him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there needs no other work or <hi>medium</hi> on their part, but deriving beings from him, to make them ſinners in their own perſons, <hi>Even ſo, by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous</hi> (even in their particular perſons, by way of imputation, and application of the Righteouſneſſe of another to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22. &amp; 4. 3, 4.) And that is ſo many as receive that abundance of grace teſtified in that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done in Chriſt for men, and that gift of righteouſneſſe by faith, verſe 17. and ſo come to have being in him, in beleeving on his name, That Righteouſneſſe that is unto All, it comes upon All that beleeve (even in their particulars) which fully ſhews, that one Righteouſneſſe was unto, or upon the whole nature of man (as men conſidered) in him the ſecond publick Man, to the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life, while all were out of him, ſeeing there needs no other work or <hi>medium</hi> on their part, no diſcovery, or receite of any peculiar grace or gift of grace for them while ſinners and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that was not for others, nor any thing elſe is requiſite for any one of this nature of man, to make them righteous in their particulars, but a receiving by faith that true in Chriſt, for, and towards them as men and ſinners with the reſt, even that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace, that love of God to Manward, <hi>Tit. 3. 4. Rom.</hi> 5. 6, 8. and that gift of righteouſneſſe, The Son of God ſent the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. and 4. 14. Therein they are made righteous by the imputation and application of the righteouſnes of another to them. By him all that beleeve are therein through his name juſtified from all, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes, Act.</hi> 10. 43. &amp; 13. 39. which ſhews the truth of Juſtification &amp; Righteouſneſſe perfect in him for them as men, and ſinners conſidered, that ſo in beleeving in him, without the works of the Law, or any other <hi>medium</hi> it might be received by any of that nature, the whole nature is juſtified, and acquit of that firſt diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſo of the guilt or condemnation of that ſinfulnes in them, as meerly and neceſſarily derived from it; In that he in the common nature, and in the room of them all as the ſecond publick man, is juſtified for them; <hi>In his Reſurrection, he was taken from the priſon, and from the judgement,</hi> Iſa. 53 8. And this ſo verily, and vertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lly for them all; <hi>That the Father now judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son,</hi> Joh. 5. 22. He doth not go to Law, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118359:35"/>
to Judgement with men, according to that Law and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which without a Saviour they ſtood as condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, under which Chriſt was made for them; Though men ſtill according to his Ordinance paſſe through the firſt mortality, and death, as the fruit of ſin, yet not as the due, and proper wages thereof, and therefore ſhall not periſh in that death, he having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out the ſting and poyſon, that would have made it deſtructrive, by his coming, and paſſing through it, and ſo aboliſhed it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. nor according to that Judgement.</p>
            <p>The truth of which appears, not onely in theſe ſerious and full Aſſertions of it, but likewiſe by divers arguments, or reaſons uſed by the Scripture to evince it; As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The nature of all preſent and eternal condemnations in the Scripture, <hi>They are not becauſe the fathers have eaten ſowr grapes, and the childrens teeth, are thereby neceſſarily ſet on edge, but every one for his own proper iniquity,</hi> Ezek. 18. 2-4. no man condemned, or abiding under the wrath of God for preſent, or ſhall be eternally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, meerly becauſe he was ſimple or in darkneſſe, or becauſe he was filthy and poluted, but becauſe he loved his ſimplicity when the wiſdome of God was oft, and long reproving him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 22, 23, 24. &amp;c. <hi>When light came they loved darkneſſe rather,</hi> Joh. 3. 19. <hi>Becauſe in thy filthineſſe was lewdneſſe, or ſtubborneſſe,</hi> and that thus evidenced, and of this nature;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And this could not have been the nature of condemnations, preſent or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither had the world been capable of ſinning ſins of that nature, as for which they are now charged, and under condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if Chriſt had not done for them the things mentioned in this Text, given himſelf a Ranſome for them, and become a Mediator, and by vertue thereof a <hi>Teſtimony in due time unto them.</hi> See our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſo reaſoning, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 22. 24. If he had not done that for them which never man did, or could do (namely, <hi>redeem his brother, or give to God a Ranſome for his ſoul,</hi> Pſal, 49. 7.) yea if alſo he had not ſpoken to them, preached by his Spirit to their ſpirits in the means he uſed. They had not known, or been capable of ſins after this conſideration, as now they are charged on them, that is of both ſeeing and healing when by the light comming to them they ſee both him and his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:118359:35"/>2. The truth of that ranſoming or redemption from the curſe of the Law perfect in Chriſt for men, appears further, from the grace of God extended unto men in the mercies and accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the natural life; yea, in the ſevereſt of his chaſtiſements there appears a great abatement, or taking off the greateſt part of the ſtroke, and that it is not ſuſtained as the full and proper wages of ſin, but is far leſs then our iniquities deſerve: the truth and holineſs of God was ingaged, that the ſoul that ſins muſt dye: and the death was ſuch as was wholly deſtructive, and no intermiſſion or mixture of any mercy; but the ſoul to have been continually filled with mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and confuſion, the body with pains and all diſeaſes in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, till it had been wholly turned to duſt; the rain of the land, powder and duſt; we to eat our bread in ſorrow and anguiſh of our hearts all our dayes; all curſes to follow and overtake us till we periſh; this was our portion, <hi>Gen. 3. 17, &amp;c.</hi> with <hi>Deut. 28. 15, &amp;c.</hi> neither may the truth and holineſs of God ſuffer the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cannot in clearing clear the guilty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 7.

            <p>3. The truth of this further appears, in that all ſhall be raiſed from the firſt death, and then be judged according to the Goſpel; which they could not have been, if one had not by the grace of God

            <p>2. As Jeſus Chriſt by giving himſelf a ranſome hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, and therein ſaved us from periſhing in that firſt death and miſery, having in and by himſelf taken away our ſins from before the Father, the ſin of the world after the firſt conſideration, as paſſing and being found on them, ſimply and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily through the firſt diſobedience: ſo he hath therein, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof obtained eternal redemption, even redemption of the tranſgreſſions under the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12, 15. A perfect reſtoration of all that was loſt by that ſin, and according to that judgement, a reſtoration of it, not into their perſons, but into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for them; that it might be enjoyed by faith, and in the firſt fruits of the Spirit, and the hope of the harveſt by any of them in believing in him through his name: there it is perfect in him, as in a publique perſon, or treaſury for us, who will never loſe it; That in coming in to him, it might be enjoyned by us. <hi>In him God hath given us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. He</hi> (of us to whom life is given in Chriſt) <hi>that hath the Son, hath life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not life.</hi> And yet it's given him in Chriſt, as before, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 11, 12. The ſum of our loſs, and that in which eternal life conſiſteth, is capacity and liberty to the enjoyment of the delightful favour of, and fellowſhip with God, in which is life. All have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto which they were created in the firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique man. Sin makes ſeparation between God and men; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as by it we loſt that Image of God, in which we were created, which was ſuch, as in Soul and Body together we were capable ſubjects of immediate fellowſhip with our Creator, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118359:36"/>
in alſo our liberty to ſuch enjoyment, we are in our ſelves, and as in relation to the firſt man, juſtly baniſhed, as well as enemies in our mindes, and ſo at a diſtance, ſtrangers to the life of God: but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in our nature, as the ſecond publique man, and for us, hath perfectly recovered that Image of God which we loſt, and in a better maner, and that both in Soul and Body; ſo as he is in our nature, and as the publique perſon, a capable ſubject of immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate fellowſhip with God, and hath alſo liberty: he is entertained to ſuch enjoyment, that now for us through ſufferings, he is entered into the actual poſſeſſion of glory, that he may appear effectually in the preſence of God for us, and that whoſoever comes in to him by faith, may in him appear perfect and righteous before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yea, the fulneſs of the Godhead dwells in him bodily, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>John 17. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. I have finiſhed the work thou gaveſt me to do on earth, and now I come to thee: holy Father, glorifie me with thine own ſelf, with the glory I had with thee before the world was.</hi> Compared with <hi>Col. 1. 14. 15. In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſinnes. Who is the Image of the inviſible God,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis true, the 15. verſe is a deſcription of the excellency of his perſon, <hi>In whom we have redemption:</hi> but it is alſo clearly a demonſtration of the redemption we have in him, the Image of God recovered into our nature, that through faith in him, it may be enjoyed by any of us whoſe nature he took, as aforeſaid. Seeing whatever Jeſus Chriſt is inveſted with, or is become now in our nature, though it be no other then what he had, and was before, as the eternal Son of God; yet his being ſo in our nature, is as the publique perſon for us, and on a new account by vertue of his ſuffering for us, and ſo he is, and hath it in our nature, and for us, by way of redemption or recovery. Like to this is that <hi>Heb. 1. 3, 4. God hath ſpoken to us in theſe laſt dayes by his Son, who being the brightneſs of his glory and the expreſs image of his perſon: when he had by himſelf purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſinne, ſate down the right hand of God:</hi> and ſo herein he hath reſtored our nature in himſelf, to all thoſe glorious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as Lordſhip over the creatures, as in their firſt creation. Compare <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 8. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8. and ſo the reſtoration of the creatures to their firſt ſtate and purity is obtained, and in his hands for us, to give us ſome fruits or ſtreams of the vertues of it now for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118359:37"/>
our good, and to draw us to him, in whom is all fulneſs: but the revelation of the thing it ſelf in the full accompliſhment, is reſerved till the manifeſtation of the Sons of God, which will be at, and not before the ſecond appearing of Chriſt, <hi>Acts 3. 19, 20. Rom. 8. 18, 19. Iſa. 11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we ſee Jeſus who was made a little lower then the Angels, for the ſuffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for every man. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite vertues of his ſufferings foreconſidered and eyed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was that by vertue and on the account of which, he was counted worthy of that honor, to be ſet as the ſecond publique man, to undertake and do that for all men, which none could have done for himſelf or his brother; as well as alſo by reaſon of the vertues and efficaciouſneſs of thoſe ſufferings with the Father, he having by the grace of God taſted death for every man, he is actually poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all the glory of God in our nature, and for us; for it became him for whom are all things. It did behove and was ſuitable to Gods greatneſs, and the holineſs of his nature, in, or for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Sons to glory, to make the Captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings. 1. As all are Sons of God by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mal. 2. 10. Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us?</hi> ſo for the bringing back the whole nature in the ſecond publique man, who have all ſinned in the firſt, and come ſhort of the glory of God; and therein for the opening an effectual door for their being delivered, and brought back to God in their particulars, as <hi>verſ. 14, 15. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 18. For this it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Captain of their ſalvation ſhould be made perfect in himſelf for them, through ſufferings for ſin. And 2. as all that with the heart believe unto righteouſneſs, are therein Sons of God by faith in Jeſus; ſo for the preſerving them through faith in him, and bringing them to the enjoyment of the inheritance, who have yet much evil and ſinfulneſs in them, the ſame was alſo neceſſary, that the Captain of their ſalvation ſhould be perfect through ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, who being firſt in himſelf made perfect, a perfect Saviour, Redeemer, and Recoverer of the loſs for all men, is become the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of eternal Salvation to all that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. and 5. 9. Jeſus Chriſt then according to the will and appointment of his Father, hath given himſelf a ranſome or price of redemption for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118359:37"/>
all men; which he hath redeemed them from under the firſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the curſe of the Law, and to be at his diſpoſe, and judged by him according to the Goſpel; and obtained eternal redemption and recovery of their loſs into himſelf for them as before. In which by ſtrong hand he hath alſo redeemed or ranſomed us from under the will and compulſive power and ſlavery of Satan having deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil, in ſpoiling his firſt work, in which he had prevailed, aboliſhing that death by his coming, in and by which he hath triumphed over him, and all the enemies of our ſalvation in himſelf, and received all power to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Government of God over us, having led and leading captivity captive for us, that he might deliver thoſe in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that were all their life ſubject to bondage. And here we ſhall come to the ſecond particular inſtruction, propounded for opening the large ground of praying for all men, here ſet before us, to which we ſhall ſpeak more briefly, having been large in this which is the ground of it.</p>
            <p>2. That Jeſus Chriſt by vertue of his having given himſelf, and being accepted a ranſome for all men, he is become a powerful and ſtanding Mediator between God and men. By this mediation, may be ſignified his whole work, in what he hath done, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and doth as our Saviour; and ſo he did officiate as the great Mediator between God and man, in giving himſelf a ranſome to God for us, of which we have ſpoken already; and doth officiate as the Mediator, in being a teſtimony of God and his goodneſs, in due time to us: of which we ſhall ſpeak diſtinctly in the next place: but that which we ſhall in this place ſpeak to under the terms of his being a Mediator, by, and with the vertues of the offering of his own body once for all, is his continued work with the Father for us, for the covering and taking away the ſins the world, as now charged on them, by and according to the Goſpel: God hath given him all power as a Prince and Saviour, by vertue of his ſufferings, and the ſacrifice perfected through them, (the obtaining of which was one great end of his ſufferings) to take away following evils, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the infinite vertues of his blood in that perfect ſacrifice of his own body, before the Father for them; <hi>By appearing in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 24. <hi>Where he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us,</hi> chap. 7. 25. to procure and give
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118359:38"/>
forbearance, and to keep off Gods diſpleaſure and judgements from being executed, that are provoked by their dayly fins of a new nature, that ſo the door of life may be held open, and he may be ſtill a teſtimony in due time of the Fathers goodneſs to them, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing yet means and mercies leading to repentance; and that in coming to him, they may receive forgiveneſs, and inheritance with thoſe that are ſanctified by faith in Jeſus: our high Prieſt needeth not, as the former, <hi>to offer ſacrifice dayly, firſt for his own ſins, and then for the ſins of the people: for this he did once, when he offered up himſelf.</hi> Heb. 7. 27. The firſt end of that one offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his, was, that therein and thereby he might perfectly take away from before the Father, thoſe ſins of the world after the firſt conſideration, as neceſſarily derived and found upon it through the firſt diſobedience, which ſins were charged upon him and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as his, though made ſo by way of imputation, for he <hi>knew no ſin.</hi> Pſal. 40, 12. with 2 Cor. 5. 21. And this he hath perfectly done, he hath by himſelf purged our ſin, and is ſet down on the right hand of majeſty. But this was alſo a ſecondary end of the ſame one offering, yea, the end of the firſt end, That by vertue of the infinite ſatisfaction for ſin made in his ſufferings, and the perfect righteouſneſs compleated in his ſacrifice, he might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred in the name and majeſty of his Father, to take away day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſins of the people after the ſecond conſideration even as they are now charged upon them, and the wrath of God abiding on them becauſe of them: namely, all ſins as wilfully continued in, and multiplied againſt the light and grace of the redemption ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: he needs not come down again to ſuffer, or make a new offering for the taking away any ſin, but ever liveth and continueth in the preſence of God, preſenting the vertues of that one offering, and thereby dayly ſo taketh away the ſin of the world, as now charged on them, even their wilful ignorance and unbelief of the grace of God by Chriſt, and ſo all other ſins, as the love of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt light is the occaſion of their hardning in wilful ignorance to &amp; unbelief of the light that reproves them, that comes to ſave them; and ſo as the continuing under the pollution and power of them, is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by ſuch their wilful ignorance and unbelief: ſins of this nature, I ſay, he ſo taketh away, from before the Father, by his continual interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors, as <hi>Iſa. 53. 12. Luke</hi> 13. that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118359:38"/>
judgement is not ſpeedily executed, but the for bearance, patience, and renewed goodneſs of God, yet extended, to admoniſh, allure, and lead to repentance, until any have wholly filled up the meaſure of their ſin, giving up themſelves to, and becoming one with Satan, and ſo fully made themſelves veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and to leave or give men up wholly thereto, alſo God is very ſlow, through the continuance and prevailing of Chriſts mediation for men, and for all them that turn in his reprovings, through his name believe in him, that he ſhould give them forgiveneſs of ſins, eternal life, and ſo through his name <hi>ſave them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt;</hi> he is fully impowred on the ſame account of the ends and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of his one offering, <hi>ſeeing he ever liveth with it, to make interceſſion for us.</hi> Heb. 7. 25. See how all this is ſet before us. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1, 2. in that ground given us for praying for any mans ſin, which it doth not appear to us to be ſo wholly finiſhed, as to have occaſioned or brought forth death in an utter ſeparation from God. The Apoſtle having before directed them to the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for forgivneſs and healing of their own ſins; in the beginning of this chapter he gives them this caution, that the end of his thus inſtructing them to a fountain for their cleanſing, is, <hi>Not that they ſhould continue in ſin, that grace may abound; but that they ſin not:</hi> and then proceeds to inſtruct and direct them to an uſefulneſs of, and running to the ſame fountain for other mens ſins; <hi>If any man ſin we</hi> (believers) <hi>have an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous:</hi> we have or enjoy him by faith, and ſuch uſefulneſs of him, as our Advocate appearing eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for us, to plead our cauſe, and preſent our matters according to his wiſdom, and with the odors of his incenſe, the vertues of his ſacrifice: and therefore we may preſent all our needs and matters to, and by him, becauſe he that is our Advocate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is alſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins, that having made peace by the blood of his Croſs, is alſo the ſtanding propitiation, or Mercy-Seat with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; The ſin-offering, and ſo the great and conſtant mediation for the dayly covering and taking away the iniquities and mixtures, that otherwiſe might hinder our prayers. And therefore we may make ſuch uſe of him, as for the preſenting our ſupplications for pardon of any mans ſin, according to his will declared in the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that is the propitiation for our ſins, is alſo the propitiation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:118359:39"/>
for the ſins of the whole world, even ſuch as yet lye in wickedneſs, that being the explication of the <hi>whole world,</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> by this Apoſtle. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>The ſins for which he here is ſaid to be the propitiation, are ſuch, or ſins after ſuch a conſideration, as in which we are to pray for pardon of them dayly, as we ſee them in our ſelves or others, which are onely ſins after the ſecond conſideration, that is, all or any ſins, as they are found in us, continued in, or multiplied againſt the light, or powerful inſtructions and reproofs of <hi>the grace of God that brings ſalvation to all men, and come to redeem or ſave them from any of their iniquities,</hi> as Acts 3. 26. Tit. 2. 11. 'Tis after this conſideration onely, that God by Jeſus Chriſt charges ſin upon us as our ſin, and for which his wrath or diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides upon us, that when light comes, <hi>Men love and willingly chuſe darkneſs rather, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> All the wrath on the former account being taken away, and the ſin perfectly covered and purged in Chriſt; now, 'tis our ſins as they are againſt this grace in ſo delivering or ranſoming us in and by Chriſt, and bringing this Salvation to us, for which he is angry; and that doth ſtir up new wrath and diſpleaſure; for the removal or taking away of which, we are dayly to pray with thankſgiving for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfectly done, as the ground that this may be done for us. See this clear in our types, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 1, 4. As for ſin in either guilt or pollution, as it paſſed on us, and yet may be conſidered as in or upon us, meerly and neceſſarily through the firſt diſobedience, and the poyſon of it, ſo we are not to pray for the pardon of it, or that it may be taken away from before the Father, and he may not lay it to our charge, or to the charge of any man: but in all our prayers to acknowledge and give thanks for that as already perfectly done in and by Chriſt; which if it had not, we had had neither ground nor door to approach or pray to the Father for any thing; and therefore with thankſgiving to God in the name of Chriſt for this as already done, we are to pray that both our eyes, and the eyes of others, may be opened to ſee and underſtand how great things he hath done for us: and as this inſtructeth, we are to pray on this ground for pardon and healing of ſin as wilfully contracted in us againſt light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or either as the occaſion or fruit of ignorance or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief in Chriſt as before; that ſin as found in us and others after
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118359:39"/>
this conſideration, may not be laid to our charge, but forbearance and forgiveneſs adminiſtred according to the Goſpel: now for theſe ſins, or ſins after this conſideration it is, that he is here ſaid to be the propitiation, the ſtanding propitiatory ſacrifice or mercy-ſeat, for the dayly covering with the infinite vertues of his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and offering for ſin once made, and ſo taking away dayly from before the Father the ſins of the world after this conſideration, and ſo his being the propitation for our ſins, which might hinder our prayers, and for the pardon of which, we have dayly to pray, and not onely for ours but alſo for the ſins of the whole world, is equivalent and the ſame with his being the continual and ſtanding Mediator between God and men, by, and with the vertues of that one offering of himſelf. 'Tis true, his making the atonement, or propitiation and peace in himſelf for us, in that at firſt perfectly done in giving himſelf a ranſome, is here more ſtrongly implyed and ſignified, ſeeing without it, or if that had not been done and perfect for them in Chriſt, this could not have been done for them by him: if he had not made peace, he could not have been a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propitiation for ſin; but that which is here directly ſpoken to, and ſignified by his being affirmed to be the propitiation, is according to the latter ſence.</p>
            <p>And ſo God hath ſet him forth to be a ſtanding propitiation, that through him his righteouſneſs may be declared, not onely in giving the forgiveneſs of ſins through faith in his blood, but in granting forbearance of the ſame to men that do not believe, that they might have opportunity and ſpace afforded thereto: as well as alſo to be a propitiation to, or in them, and ſo of them in their particular perſons, through faith in his blood, as <hi>Col. 1. 22. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 18. And all this through, by vertue, and by means of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. Behold then that Lamb of God that having by himſelf perfectly purged our ſin, is now ſet down on the right hand of God, and there dayly taking away the ſin of the world as now charged on it, the great Mediator between God and men, by, and with the vertues of his having given himſelf a ranſome for all men, and that he may be ſo viewed by us, conſider,</p>
            <p>3. That by vertue of his ranſome given and accepted, and his Mediation continually made with the Father for all men, he is in the name of the Father a Teſtimony, or to be teſtified to them in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:118359:40"/>
due time, to each in their ſeveral and proper ages, and to every one at ſuch time and ſeaſons, as may be moſt for their advantage and good; and now in theſe laſt ages, (the moſt ſeaſonable time for that, for divers conſiderations) by the coming of Chriſt, and his bringing light, and immortality to light, by the Goſpel to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 10. Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 3. of which more directly is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in which the ground of making prayers with thankſ givings for all men, is more opened then formerly; though it was the ſame in Chriſt before. But he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e for brevity ſake we ſhall onely ſhew how in general he is, and alwaies was unto all men every where, and in every age by vertue of his ſacrifice, accepted and vertuous with the Father from the beginning, a Teſtimony in due time, of the truth of the redemption in him, and the Fathers goodneſs through him; And that in theſe two things.</p>
            <p>1. In affording to all as they come to capacity and need of it, means, opportunity, and ſpace to repent.</p>
            <p>2. In ſending forth his good Spirit, in the ſupernatural light and power of it, in, and with thoſe mercies and means to bring the light, and underſtanding of his goodneſs to the heart, and thereby to reprove men of their evils, and turn them to God.</p>
            <p>1. In affording to all as they come to capacity and need of it, means and opportunity to repentance: for children that know not any thing, and ſo are not capable of actual doing good or evil, as they are not capable of hearing and rejecting the word of Chriſt, of voluntary chuſing and ſetting up idols in their heart, and departing from the Lord, under whoſe ſpecial care and protection, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous government by Chriſt they are: ſo there is no condemnation or charge of ſin upon them, by, or according to the Goſpel, and ſo no repentance needful, or required of them: for though born under the guilt of ſin according to the Law, (under which Chriſt was made for them) and ſo with a corrupt and polluted nature; yet by reaſon of him that hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, they are not by God held under condemnation on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count neither, nor ſhall periſh in that death.</p>
            <p>And as they have no capacity in their particulars perſonally to adhere to, and cloſe with the grace of God in Chriſt, and ſo actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to believe in him; ſo neither is that required of them by him, that requires not, but according to what he hath ſown, and in his givings
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118359:40"/>
furniſhed to, yea, he that imputes righteouſneſs without works, and doth not charge with unbelief, where there is not a hearing and rejecting, (as <hi>John</hi> 3. 19. and 12. 47.) doth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly accept and own them, by vertue of the Redemption wrought in Chriſt for them; yea, and reckons them as believers, and ſo of the kingdom; and as a teſtimony of that, would have them brought to him, and accepts that as their coming, and ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall receive one ſuch little child in his name, therein receiveth and acknowledgeth him,</hi> Mat. 18. 5, 6. and 19. 13, 14. yet in them Chriſt is a teſtimony of the truth of the Redemption in him, and the Fathers goodneſs through him unto all men, in preſerving their natural life, while he continues it to them, to the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble injoyment of his mercies, and free from the ſting and poyſon of the firſt death, and eaſing them of ſo much of the pains and miſeries of thoſe ſhadows of that death and mortality that is upon them, as he ſees good for them and for us. In which as there is no deſtructiveneſs in that which remaines, ſo there is a great abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and taking off, even of the greateſt part of the ſtroke or curſe which the truth of God required ſhould have been executed upon us in them, by reaſon of our ſin; not onely to bring forth in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but for trouble without caſe, <hi>Curſed ſhalt thou be in the fruit of thy body,</hi> Gen. 3. 16. Deut. 28. 18. we may ſay, (as ſometimes concerning <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 45. 7.) It appears by Gods preſent gratious dealing with us in them, that God hath ſent a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoph</hi> into our condition of miſery, and made him under our Law and curſe before us, and he is now through ſufferings entered into glory, become a Prince and a Saviour. All is committed into his hands, to preſerve to us a poſterity in the earth, and to ſave our lives together, to the comfortable enjoyment of his mercies by a great deliverance; yea, this will be to them a teſtimony of Gods goodneſs through the Redemption, when they come to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of conſidering it, and ſuch as may be ſo diſcerned by them, and uſeful to them, if they put not from them the inſtructions of the grace of God, as it was to <hi>David, Pſal. 71. 6. Thou art he that haſt preſerved or holden me up from the womb, as well as taken me of my Mothers Bowels: my praiſe ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually of thee.</hi> Whence we are exhorted in youth, and its the firſt and main thing we ſhould mind our children of, as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,

To remember our Creator, to call to minde his goodneſs in creating, and ſo in preſerving us hitherto, that through his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Son may be ſo comfortably and profitably remembred by us: but as they come to capacity to know any thing and act accordingly, though the grace of God that brings ſolvation to all men, inſtruct and require of them to cloſe with it according to the means and capacities afforded, yet they are all generally going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray naturally, and not regarding to underſtand or know the way of peace, but cloſing their eyes againſt the light, and corrupting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more and more; notwithſtanding which, ſuch is the love of God to manward, <hi>He would not that any ſhould periſh but come to repentance, and be ſaved:</hi> he heartily deſires, they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inſtructions and reproofs of his goodneſs, turn from their dumb Idols and evil wayes, unto the living God; and as a teſtimony of it, having opened in and by his Son, ſuch a large and effectual door to this purpoſe, and that at ſo coſtly a rate, he alſo gives his Son in the iſſues and ſtreamings forth of the vertue of his ſacrifice, a continual witneſs or teſtimony to them while it is in due time. And ſo concerning ſuch we ſay, Jeſus Chriſt is by vertue of his ſacrifice and mediation, ſtill preſerving this natural life (while he pleaſes to continue it) unto the comfortable enjoyment of his mercies, and renewing gracious means and opportunities to them, <hi>That they might repent and ſeek after God, who is not far off from every one of them,</hi> but neer them in the gracious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of his hands, and in his good affection and deſire of their good by them: <hi>for therefore, in by or through him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27. And ſo by him they are preſeved from ſo much of the deſtruction and confuſion of minde, and of the pains and torments on the body, that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wages of our ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they are (unleſs in ſome rare examples, in whom God alſo requires not more or otherwiſe, then according to what he hath ſown or furniſhed with) capable ſubjects of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and conſidering the mercies of God and underſtanding, and making ſuch uſe of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as may tend to the comfortable being of the natural life; and ſo of converſing with, and attending to thoſe outward mediums, in which Gods Spirit is converſant and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lead them to repentance, (of which more anon.) And indeed all thoſe mercies and accommodations of the natural life are made
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118359:41"/>
ſuch mediums, and to that purpoſe is he alſo by vertue of the ſame ſacrifice and mediation, continuing and renewing in his providences as he ſees good, his mercies, in Creatures, Scriptures, or both; and ordering alſo favourable chaſtiſements, in which he debates with them in meaſure, and changing his providences about them, that they may not ſettle on their l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And herein is Jeſus Chriſt a great and continual Witneſs of Gods goodneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiouſneſs towards them, and of the truth of the Redemption in him declared in the Goſpel, as is foreſhewed in the ſecond Reaſon propounded for demonſtration of the truth of his having redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</p>
            <p>2. Jeſus Chriſt is alſo a Teſtimony, and ſo he, and the Father in him teſtified to men in due time, in ſending forth the ſupernatural light and power of his good Spirit, in, and with all theſe outward means, to bring the light of the knowledge of his goodneſs to their hearts, and therein open their ears, and give capacity by his words and in his calling, that men might hear and anſwer: for though the former be done, the natural life preſerved, the outward mediums afforded, and man a capable ſubject of beholding, injoying, and attending to thoſe mediums without diſtraction; yet is he not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply hereby, or by any power in him, as naturally of him, capable of finding out the knowledge of the things of God in Chriſt, or cloſing with them, as declared and witneſſed in thoſe mediums: the world by wiſdom found not out God in the wiſdom of God; the carnal minde is enmity to God; it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can it be, ſo that they that are in the fleſh, all have fleſh in them; but they that are in it, wholly given up to it, ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and guided by the teaching or operation of the wiſdom, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or luſts of the fleſh, they cannot pleaſe God; we have no ſufficiency in our ſelves, as of our ſelves, not ſo much as to think any thing as we ought; But our ſufficiency is of God, and ſo of God, as not of our ſelves; not by a meer natural bleſſing, or ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up and ſtrengthening any thing that is naturally of us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though thoſe natural faculties and powers may be well imployed as far as renewed by grace, but then they muſt be renewed and acted by ſuch

            <p>There is therefore requiſite ſuch a maner of putting forth of light, and exerciſe of the power of Gods Spirit in the natural faculties of the Soul or Spirit of man, to make it capable of comprehending, perceiving, or cloſing with the things of God in Chriſt, as is to man ſupernatural, he being naturally, in and of himſelf, as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of hearing the voyce of the Son of God in the Goſpel, as thoſe that are in the graves are in and of themſelves uncapable of hearing and complying with that voyce of the Son of God, by which they ſhall be raiſed; and therefore thoſe deaths are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the one to the other, <hi>John</hi> 5. 25, 28. though theſe are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (as before ſhewed) of attending to thoſe means, in which the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural light and force of the Spirit of God is put forth and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed for bringing the voyce of the Son of God nigh to them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening their ears, and giving capacity to hear it, and quickening by it, anſwerable to which the other have no ſuch capacity; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the voyce of the Son of God ſhall come forth to that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately: however then it is requiſite, that in, or through thoſe outward mediums there be ſuch a maner of coming forth and operation of the Spirit of God, as is anſwerable to that by which Jeſus Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, <hi>and the dead ſhall be raiſed:</hi> 'tis the ſame Spirit by which he moved, and acted, and walked up and down in his life, in the fleſh, or in the dayes of his weakneſs and mortality, and ſo the ſame Spirit by which men are taught and ſtrengthened to their natural motions, actions, or imployments in things tending to the good or comfortable being of the natural life, but not in the ſame maner put forth or exerciſed; but as we may ſay, In a natural or ordinary way, by bleſſing natural faculties, and abilities, in, and according to a natural improvement, in ſuch maner, as the nature of man by that which God hath already fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed it withall, is capable of receiving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and complying with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But for this, though that light and power of the Spirit is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the A poſtle deſiring for the believing <hi>Epheſians,</hi> That they might through the knowledge of him more abundantly experiment the exceeding greatneſs of his mighty power or arm that is in the Goſpel, that it might more have its prevalency with them, as it is put forth through that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him for the ſpecial ſaving of them that believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16, 17. he compares it <hi>to the maner of the working of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power, which he wrought in Chriſt Jeſus, when he raiſed him from the dead,</hi> Eph. 1. 17, 19, 20. Now this is that which we have here further to ſay on Gods behalf, aſcribing righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our maker; That according to mans need by reaſon of his natural weakneſs and depravedneſs God is certainly liberally giving to all men without upbraiding any, ſuch gifts as may conduce to their getting wiſdom in the knowledge of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him; for he gives nothing but good and perfect givings, not onely out of a cordial heart and affection, but ſuch as would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce what they come for, and inſinuate themſelves by their own light and force, and make the ſubject capable of receiving and complying with them, and this is given us as a general ground for any man to ask wiſdom of God (<hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5, 17.) and that without wrath or doubting, and not to murmur or rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in his Goſpel, or the inſtruction thereof, in which his arm is thus ſtretched out: ſo <hi>Pſal. 68. 18, 19.

And therefore God gives up men in his juſt Judgement to blindneſs, <hi>That hearing they ſhould hear, and not underſtand</hi> &amp;c. becauſe they made it firſt their voluntary ſin, in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to hear; but cloſing their eyes, ſtopping their ears, ſhunning the light when it came, becauſe their deeds were reproved by it, and leſt they ſhould be converted from them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 11, 13, 15. <hi>John</hi> 3. 19. <hi>They received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 10, 11.

You have been drawn and come not, as thoſe <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 2, 7. but did break his bands by murmuring among themſelves, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 3, 5. ſo here compare <hi>verſ.</hi> 43. and 44.

            <p>Therefore even now more earneſtly and heartily to receive, while the Father was giving to them, as he affirms the Father was then giving to them, or did then give them the true bread, though they did not accept or feed on it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. And thus it fully agrees with that, <hi>John</hi> 12. 35, 36. <hi>Yet a little while is the Light with you; walk while ye have the light, leſt darkneſs come, and then ye cannot walk:</hi> and that, Jam. 1. 18, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c. Of his own good will,</hi> or willingly <hi>begat he us through the word of truth,</hi> (which is preached to every man, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27, 28, 29.) wherefore let every man be ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak, ſlow to wrath, or murmuring againſt that Word of truth, ſeeing it's Gods Arm ſent to ſave him: and like to this, that, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13. <hi>It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do,</hi> &amp;c. Do all things without murmuring and diſputings, that ye may not fail of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacies of his grace in you, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 15, 16. And indeed the grace of God bringeth ſalvation to all men, in all the ſeveral ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances and ſtreamings forth thereof, in his mercies, chaſtiſements, providences, though more fully and plainly in the records and plain Declaration of the Goſpel, and eſpecially as now come forth: yet even in his works of creation and providence, which by vertue of the redemption wrought in Chriſt, men do behold, and have a comfortable enjoyment of, even where they do not enjoy the other more plain Declarations of Jeſus Chriſt, the choice means; yet therein, and to them, in and with thoſe means they have, Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit is witneſſing the goodneſs of God to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſo that God is not without a witneſs in thoſe mercies they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118359:44"/>
enjoy, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 17. yea, the word or teſtimony of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as preached in them, is not afar off, but nigh them, in their heart, in their mouth, that it might be ſeen and acknowledged; and it is leading, perſwading, and drawing their hearts to repeatance in the acknowledgement of the truth: that which may be known of God in thoſe diſcoveries of him vouchſafed, is manifeſt in them, and that is Goſpel or good news of goodneſs and propitiouſneſs in God; yea, ſo as through a Saviour, this is preached in every creature, though that Saviour is not diſtinctly revealed as in the Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 24, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 21. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 23. Neither doth God require of them any Repentance, Faith, or Acknowledgement of him, but according to the capacities and manifeſtations given them; and is very favourable and full of forbrearance, though all men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally fail and come ſhort of that; and is yet waiting to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them, in continuing the mediums of calling, and while he is doing ſo, ſtretching out his hand all the day long: and if God ſee it good for them or any of them, to give them ſome more diſtinct revelation and diſcovery of the perſon and work of Chriſt, as he hath alſo promiſed, that in turning in his reproofs, he will ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pour out his Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make known his words: and however, I ſay, what diſcovery or revelation of Chriſt ſoever he ſees good and needful for any of them, though they have not the Scriptures, the outward means thereto, he can teach the ſame things without them; yea, where by his providence they are not vouchſafed, his Spirit is ſo converſant, and in ſuch maner with the books of creation and providence, as to teach and lead to that uſe of them, which by the Scriptures he teaches us to make of them, as it hath been ſeen in the caſes of ſuch as have been deaf and dumb; God hath taught them the ſame things concerning Chriſt, and his goodneſs through him, by thoſe things which they ſaw and had to do with, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have learned through diſcourſe, and in uſe of thoſe Organs they wanted: and if they had wanted the other alſo, he could have taught the ſame things without that too, for he ſpeaks to the heart, and gives wiſdom to the inward parts; none teacheth like him; and though he ever make uſe of outward mediums where and according to what he vouchſafes, yet he is bound to none of them; and is alſo eſpecially tender towards ſuch as enjoy leaſt of them, being by his providence deprived, in requiring leſs of them,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118359:44"/>
and no more then according to what he gives, and by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in keeping ſtrong temptations and ſtumbling-blocks from before them, and out of their way, and in dealing with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their need and wants; whence exhorting us to be like him, he directs particularly in this, <hi>Thou ſhalt not curſe the deaf, nor put a ſtumbling-block before the blinde,</hi> Levit. 19. 1, 14. but eſpecially open thy mouth for them, <hi>&amp;c. Prov.</hi> 31. 8, 9, yea, expreſly they have all heard, and that ſo, as by ſent Preachers, and that ſo, as that they might believe; and to that end ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15, 18. After he hath told us, that they cannot believe without ſent Preachers among them; making this concluſion, <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing,</hi> even capacity to hear, <hi>by</hi> or with <hi>the word,</hi> according to the preaching thereof vouchſafed: then he propound the queſtion, <hi>I ſay then, Have they not all heard?</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers generally, Yes, they have; and particularly to thoſe that have not obeyed, yet they have heard, and that by means of ſent Preachers too, which by the next verſe, alluding to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. the works of creation and providence are, <hi>whoſe line is gone out into all the world, and their words to the ends of the earth,</hi> and by them he ſaith, All have heard; and then diſtinctly ſpeaks of Iſraels having more ſpecial means of knowledge. Jeſus Chriſt then is <hi>the true light, that enlightneth every man that cometh into the world:</hi> he is to all, by vertue of his ranſome, a Teſtimony in due time, the Light of the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See, for further underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uſefulneſs of this, the firſt inſtruction propounded by way of uſefulneſs of the firſt propoſition, and particularly the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe two Scriptures compared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. I ſhall not here otherwiſe in large to uſefulneſs, having been already more large then I intended, in this demonſtration or opening of the ground of praying with thankſgiving for all, in theſe three heads: That Chriſt by the gracious will and appointment of God, gave himſelf, and is an accepted ranſome for all: And that by vertue of this, he is become a ſtanding Mediator between God and men, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the preſence of God for them: And by means of both theſe, that he is in the name and majeſty of the Father, a teſtimony in due time to them: onely here let me adde, In all this, and this is the ſumming up of the meſſage, <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all;</hi> he is perfectly one and the ſame according to this
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118359:45"/>
manifeſtation of his good will, that men ſhould be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the truth, in and through the Mediator.</p>
            <p>There is not two divided and contrary wills in God, one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and another ſecret: he is one in his will, as well as in his Eſſence, and in all his holy and glorious Attributes, and that one will of God is a good, perfect, and acceptable will for men to know, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. and revealed, that it may be underſtood, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 17. Therefore they ſhall be beaten that did not know it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manifeſtations given them, becauſe though of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they could not, yet by his grace bringing ſalvation to all men, they might have known it, <hi>Luke 12. 48. Tit.</hi> 2. 11. And though there be many diſtinct things in that will of God (as <hi>John</hi> 6. 39, 40. ſee the opening of that before, in the Explication of the Thankſgivings to be joyned with Prayers made for all men,) yet no claſhings or contradictions; for if his Kingdom be divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf, it cannot ſtand; according to our Saviours Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And therefore though many things in it not before ſo revealed as now they are, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 3, 9.) <hi>By the appearing of Chriſt, who hath brought life and immortality to light by the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 10. and many things not yet ſo revealed as they ſhall be at the ſecond appearing of Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. yet there is nothing in thoſe Revelations we have contrary to thoſe before, but more full Declarations and openings of that life that was from the beginning, and of the love of God to manward, as appearing in the face of Chriſt, 1 <hi>John 1. 1, 5. Rom.</hi> 16. 25, 26. with <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 22. And ſo neither is there any thing not revealed, contrary to that which is already revealed; but the truth and goodneſs of that as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, ſhall more fully and brightly be manifeſted, for God is one, and there is one Mediator between God and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſome for all men, a Teſtimony in due time.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, afford plentiful ground to make Prayers and Thankſgivings for all men, 1. For the end of all Prayers for them, that Gods way may be known upon Earth, and his ſaving health among all Nations; that mens eyes might be opened to ſee it, that ſo they might be turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they might be ſaved, there is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118359:45"/>
good ground for Prayers to be made with Thankſgivings to this end. For, firſt, There is certainly and truth in the grace of God to manward, as manifeſted in and through Chriſt; and ſecondly, That is, and is to be manifeſted to all men by one means or other, and in due time, ſo as, and to that end, that it might be known, that through him they might be ſaved: <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Men not believing this, muſt needs pray ſuch Prayers doubtingly.</p>
            <p>2. For thoſe particulars of forgiveneſs, or forbearance of ſins, and renewed patience and goodneſs to be extended, ſo as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the great end of all Prayers for them; good ground to make our Prayers with Thanſgiving, and without wrath and doubting: for Jeſus Chriſt by vertue of his ranſome given for all, is the great Mediator between God and them, that he may be teſtified in due time.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>wills therefore, that men pray everywhere;</hi> and that therein <hi>Supplication, Prayers, Interceſſions and giving of Thanks be made for all men.</hi> It follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Kings, and all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall hence note a third general Inſtruction, which is fully contained in this verſe, as compared with the former, and with the occaſion of the exhortation before ſhewed; and in the opening of which, we may meet with the underſtanding and uſefulneſs of what is ſet before us in this part of the Apoſtles exhortation and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Namely,</p>
            <p>3. That in purſuance of this great deſigne, for the good of all men, and more particularly, as mainly tending to the furtherance of the ſame; that believers <hi>may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty: Prayers, and Thanksgivings, are to be made</hi> (as in general <hi>for all men,</hi> ſo) particularly <hi>for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</hi> We ſhall open it in theſe branches:</p>
            <p>1. That it tends very much to the good of all men, that believers <hi>lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſs and honeſty</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
            <p>2. That therefore God likes it well, and requires it, that thoſe whom he ſets in Authority, or eminent place, places of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118359:46"/>
ſhould all of them have a ſpecial eye at this, that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that worſhip him, and would live quietly in the land, that they <hi>may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty,</hi> under their protection and Government.</p>
            <p>3. We ſhall conſider, what thoſe things are in general that will tend to this, and which are required of Governours, that believers may lead ſuch a life.</p>
            <p>4. What that is that will eſpecially furniſh them to theſe things, and ſo is eſpecially to be deſired for them.</p>
            <p>1. That it tends very much to the good of all men, that believers <hi>lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. We ſhall here,</p>
            <p>1. Conſider what it is to <hi>lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. See how this tends ſo much to the good of all men to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by us.</p>
            <p>1. For the firſt, what it is to <hi>lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> Note, That it is not every, or any kinde of leading the life quietly or peaceably, that is commendable in the believer, and will be profitable unto others; but the <hi>leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty:</hi> like that, <hi>Heb. 12. 14. Follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> holineſs, and ſo here godlineſs and honeſty is the main thing to be purſued, and in which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is alwayes to continue and be exerciſed; and holding faſt and exerciſing himſelf therein, he is to follow peace with all men, to ſtudy to be quiet, as much as is poſſible to live peaceably with all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 17, 18. He is not to wave, ſwerve, nor ſhrink from his continuance in, and exerciſe of godlineſs and honeſty, to get peace with any, or live quietly with them: that will be worthily reputed a loving the things of the world, and the love and fellowſhips of, or peace with men more then him, or the praiſe of men more then the praiſe that comes of God alone, and will render a man unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him, <hi>Mat. 10. 32, 39. John</hi> 12. 42, 43. Yet a man living in all godlineſs and honeſtly, he may lead his life quietly and peaceably, with and amongſt thoſe that are ungodly, turbulent, unjuſt, and deviſing deceitful matters againſt him, and that for Chriſts ſake and the Goſpels; or at leaſt he may endeavour it as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118359:46"/>
much as is poſſible, by being for peace even while they are for war, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 13, 14, 20. and 120. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. and yet not joyne or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with them in their ungodly principles or wayes, nor allow or have fellowſhip with their unfruitful works of darkneſs; but in a conſtant holding faſt faith and a good conſcience exerciſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in godlineſs and honeſty, be alwayes fleeing from and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, departing from iniquity according to the teaching, of that name and grace of Chriſt profeſſed by him, and ſo reproving them, bearing witneſs and ſtriving againſt their ſin, and that with meekneſs, long-ſuffering, and doctrine, and yet with conſtancy, <hi>Heb. 12. 3, 4. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 19, 26. and 4. 1, 5.</p>
            <p>However then, this is firſt to be minded; the Saints of God, ſuch as through grace believe, they are to lead their lives, and be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually exerciſed, each according to their capacity, in godlineſs and honeſty.</p>
            <p>Godlineſs is the true or right worſhipping of God, the honouring or glorifying of him, and walking in a right acknowledgement of him in all things, and ſo in ſervice of him according to the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that grace, that brings ſalvation to all men, which in that appearance of it by Chriſt: teacheth that denying all ungodlineſs,—we ſhould live godly. See it explicated by this Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8, 10. Having exhorted <hi>Timothy</hi> to exerciſe himſelf to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on this account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it's profitable to all things, he proves that thus, <hi>verſe 10. For therefore we both labour, and ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach becauſe we truſt in the living God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of them that believe:</hi> where comparing the verſes, it appears, that the truſting in, and ſo the whole worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the living God in and according to that declaration of his name in his Son, where he hath revealed himſelf to be the living God, the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of them that believe; This is godlineſs or right worſhipping of God: and ſo to be exerciſed herein and hereto, was to exerciſe himſelf to godlineſs, which he ſhould finde profitable to all things, even to his teaching and ſtrengthening in this preſent day to all his ſervice and ſuffering. And ſo with this 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8, 10. agrees that deſcription of a godly perſon, <hi>Pſal. 1. He that walks not in the counſel of the ungodly nor ſtands in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornful,</hi> he refuſeth fooliſh and unlearned queſtions and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118359:47"/>
poſitions of ſcience falſely ſo called, ſuch teachings, counſels, and documents, about the worſhip and acknowledgement of God or of Chriſt, as in which God in Chriſt is not honoured accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his word; But the great teſtimony of God concerning him, which is the ſumme of all the matter of the Fathers teaching or learning, (<hi>Joh. 6. 45. Eph.</hi> 4. 20, 22.) and the key of knowledge for opening all things pertaining to the knowledg and worſhip of God, is laid by. And ſo the fear and worſhip taught by the precepts of men, or after the wiſdom of this world, which is fooliſhneſs with God, and teaches enmity to the truth, and way of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God as it is in Jeſus: he avoids, refuſeth, and ſhuns ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, and alſo flees youthful, and fleſhly or worldly luſts, and exerciſeth himſelf to godlineſs: (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. and 6. 11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 22, 23.) that is, as in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> his delight and continual exerciſe is in the law or doctrine of the Lord, the old Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preached from the beginning, the teſtimony of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt the law of liberty, as explicated <hi>James</hi> 1. 25. he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into it, and continueth therein; his faith, his fear, his whole wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, acknowledgement, and ſervice, is taught by and according thereto; he ſhall be ſtable, ſucceſsful, and ſo bleſſed in his deed: and accordingly we have a deſcription of ungodly perſons, though hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a form of godlineſs, yet denying the power, the root and life thereof. And with it a declaration of the general reaſon they are ſo unſtable and eaſily toſſed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 4. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14.) and do ſo much miſcarry in their apprehenſions of all things pertaining to the knowledge and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, <hi>They erre in viſion, they ſtumble in judgement:</hi> Iſa. 28. 7. and 29. 9. the deſcription of them, I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon of ſuch their erring and inſtability, we have, <hi>Iſa. 29. 11. The viſion of all was become unto them as the words of a book that is ſealed,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo rendered by them to others: and this fundamental blindneſs, it may ſeem, God had now in part given them up unto; but it was becauſe they had firſt wilfully cloſed their own eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and made it their own proper wilful iniquity, againſt the light and reproof of grace, (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 10, 11, 12, 13. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15.)</p>
            <p>The Viſion of all is Jeſus Chriſt, as declared in the Goſpel, in whoſe face now God hath manifeſted the light of his glory, ſo as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118359:47"/>
he that ſeeth him, ſeeth him that ſent him; he that believeth on him, believeth on him that ſent him, <hi>John 12. 44, 46. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 6. yea, he is that true light, that in revealing the Father, doth manifeſt all things in their proper colours. The Light of the world, <hi>John</hi> 8. 12. and 12. 46. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13. That viſion ſpoken of, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 2, 3. compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 37. 'Tis to us Jeſus Chriſt, as now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in that preaching of the Croſs who was before witneſſed in the Law and Prophets: compare <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 11, 14. with 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 18, 19. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore called the Viſion of all, becauſe it's the Viſion of all Viſions; the foundation and key of knowledge for the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all doctrines, the great things of Gods Law, <hi>Hoſea 8. 12. Mat. 23. 13, 23. Luke</hi> 11. 52. and alſo becauſe it's the Viſion of, for, and to all men; the light of the world; it holds forth tidings of great joy, of greateſt and moſt excellent concernment for them all, and at all times, <hi>Luke 1. 10, 11, 14. Prov. 8. 1, 6, 7. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 15. This is rendered as a ſealed book, when the Goſpel as preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prophets and Apoſtles, in, and according to the import of its own expreſſions, is looked upon and preſented as a Riddle, or hidden thing, in which truth is not plainly manifeſted, but one thing ſpoken, and another meant; or the meaning locked or ſealed up from us under other expreſſions (contrary to 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1, 4.) when the pen of the Scribe, eſpecially in thoſe things main and fundament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, is rendered as vain and too empty to give his ſence and meaning: and yet men pretend wiſdom, and that they have the Law of the Lord with them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>This Viſion of all being a ſealed book, upon this account it's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of ſuch, Their whole fear and worſhip, though they honour him with their lips, is taught by mens precepts, and therefore not right worſhipping.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of ſuch an Aſſertion concerning the whole worſhip meerly on this account, is this: The ſumme of the Goſpel being hid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are loſt, or out of the way, and cannot have any right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or uſefulneſs of the inſtructions of the word of the Lord, as to their worſhip of him, having rejected the ſumme and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of it; and that in which the fellowſhip of the Spirit is to be met with for opening the reſt. <hi>They have therein rejected the word of the Lord, and what wiſdom is in them?</hi> Jer. 8. 8, 9. 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:118359:48"/>And this is the reaſon of their roeling and erring in all things hard to be underſtood, they are unlearned and unſtable, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. that is, not having learned Chriſt aright; and ſo all truth as it is in Jeſus, that Viſion of all; or not attending and waiting to learn, and have the uſefulneſs of all truth, according to their needs and capacities, through the knowledge and uſefulneſs of that ſumme of the Goſpel, the teſtimony of God concerning him, as <hi>Iſa. 28. 10, 11, 12, 14, 16. John 6. 45<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 46. Eph.</hi> 4. 21. They therefore preſently pervert thoſe things in the Scriptures hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; and then alſo to frame their apprehenſions in every thing to ſuch pervertings of the Scriptures, in things hard, they pervert all other Scriptures to their own deſtruction. Theſe are ſuch ungodly ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as yet have a form of godlineſs, but deny the power, reſiſt and oppoſe the truth, as it is in Jeſus. The Father is not rightly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or worſhipped by them: <hi>The true Worſhippers worſhip the Father in Spirit and truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> John 4. 23. The truth of all types, promiſes, and former revelations of God to men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in, and according to which the Father is to be worſhipped, is Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. The teſtimony of Jeſus, as now come forth, is to us the Spirit of propheſie, through, and according to which the Father and Son, God in Chriſt is to be acknowledged, believed in and worſhipped by us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. And thus our Saviour explicates that <hi>John</hi> 4. 23. according to theſe two Scriptures compared, in <hi>John 5. 22, 23, 24. The Father judgeth no man,</hi> (that is, otherwiſe then as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) <hi>but hath committed all judgement to the Son, to this end, that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> that now in honouring the Son, as come forth and glorified in our nature through ſufferings, they may therein truely &amp; acceptably honour or worſhip the Father. And for further opening how and wherein the Son is rightly honoured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo the Father in him, he addes, <hi>He that heareth my word,</hi> (that revelation of the Father, that he was delivered to death for our offences, &amp; raiſed for our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as declared in the Goſpel giveth) and through and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it <hi>beliveeth on him that ſent me, he hath ever laſting life,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore believers are exhorted to hold faſt the believing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the things heard from the beginning, the word of the beginning of Chriſt, and to have recourſe thereto, (as to that Spirit or Unction; it being the immediate birth or off-ſpring of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118359:48"/>
the Spirit it ſelf, and ſo Spirit, according to that rule, <hi>John 3. 6. His name an oynment poured forth,</hi> Cant. 1. 2.) for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all things, for preſerving from every evil word and work, for direction and furniture to all ſervice and ſuffering, <hi>1 Cor. 15. 1, 4. 2 Tim. 2. 7, 8. 1 John 2. 20, 24, 27.</hi> And therein, and ſo they ſhall be found exerciſing themſelves to godlineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honeſty</hi> ſignifies righteouſneſs, equity or juſtice in our demeanour towards all men, and that ſuch as in which there is chaſtity or ſincerity to the main deſign for which we are ſet in the world; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of heart, and cleanneſs of hands, in proſecuting the good of all men, working righteouſneſs, or walking righteouſly in all our converſation with and amongſt them, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. and 24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 15. According to the teachings of that grace of God, that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſalvation to all men: and ſo in like expreſſions, it is joyned with living godly, in that <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. and oppoſed to worldly luſts: <hi>The grace of God that brings ſalvation to all men, hath appeared, teaching us, That denying ungodlineſs, and wordly luſts, we ſhould live righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world; looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the mighty God our Saviour: who gave himſef for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, that he might purifie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> So 1 Pet. 2. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. it's oppoſed to fleſhly luſts; which being heeded and liſtened to, do hinder the Soul of ſo living honeſtly. <hi>Therefore dearly beloved,</hi> (ſaith Peter) <hi>I beſeech you as ſtrangers and pilgrims, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from fleſhly luſts that warre againſt the Soul, having your converſation honeſt among the Gentiles, that in the day of their viſitation they may glorifie God.</hi> Like that, Phil. 2. 15, 16. <hi>Do all things without murmurings and diſputings, that ye may be blameleſs, harmleſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sons of God in the midſt of a crooked ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; amongſt whom ſhine ye as lights in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holding forth the word of life;</hi> and that both in word and converſation. The doing that which is juſt and equal between man and man, and ſo unto all, or that which is ſo in the ſight of men, this is certainly here meant by, or contained in living honeſtly, as <hi>Phil. 2. 16. Rom. 12. 17. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 15. and 3. 16. But this alone is too ſcant a definition of the living honeſtly here meant: yet all that is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it, is no more, but a walking righteouſly, and doing that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118359:49"/>
which is lawful &amp; right; but that which is ſo in the ſight of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and according to the teachings of that <hi>grace of God that brings ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all men,</hi> goes further then that which is ſo <hi>in the ſight of men:</hi> and they are both together in this living honeſtly, as may be ſeen in one inſtance, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 20, 21. That no man might blame them in the abundance adminiſtred by them, they did provide things honeſt not onely in the ſight of God, but alſo in the ſight of men:</hi> ſignifying, that they did provide things honeſt, or walk honeſtly in the ſight of God, in adminiſtring abundantly of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God had given them for the good of others; which was ſo far beyond what men would have required as their reaſonable ſervice, or judged to have been but their honeſty, that they would rather watch for advantages againſt them to blame them, as if their zeal and forwardneſs in freely and abundantly adminiſtring ſuch as they had, for the good of others, did hinder them from looking well to themſelves, or their own houſe or relations, or made them uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of walking juſtly in all their dealings. They could not (they thought) do ſo much, and be ſo free in ſpending themſelves in ſuch ſervices, if they did not defraud or wrong ſome body. But this blame, or all juſt cauſe of it is avoided by us, ſays the Apoſtle, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding things honeſt alſo in the ſight of all men, even in ſuch caſes as aforementioned: the mercies of God, (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.) even that <hi>grace that brings ſalvation to all men,</hi> teacheth and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of us, as our reaſonable ſervice, as that which on the account of that grace is due from us to all men, (as hath been ſhewed before) even as we would not be unjuſt or injurious in withholding good from them to whom its due, ſo to hold forth the faithful word in the midſt of a crooked generation, according to all that capacity and opportunity for the ſame, he is pleaſed to furniſh us with, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may loſe or ſuffer therein; and to do this cordially and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently for the good of others, that they may be ſaved, and therefore in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, renouncing the hidden things of diſhoneſty, in ſuch our ſervice, nor cloaking covetouſneſs over with it, or deſire of glory from men, or the like, ſuch is the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of their honeſty or living honeſtly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12, 13. Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and godly ſincerity we have had our converſation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is thus ſhewed, for we write none other things unto you, then what
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118359:49"/>
you read, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we intend not to ſignifie in our writing any other thing then what we plainly expreſs in our words. So 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 1, 2. Seeing we have this miniſtery as we have received mercy;</hi> (ſo in the former) by the grace of God minded by us, the inſtructions and operations thereof, we have thus had our converſation, according to that <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. By theſe mercies give up your bodies, <hi>&amp;c. As we have received mercy,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>we faint not, but have renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty, not walking in craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the truth:</hi> commending, declaring, and committing our ſelves, our minde or meaning, and principles to every man in our words, ſo as in the ſight of God; who otherwiſe would charge us with diſhoneſty, though men could not, if we did either for fear or ſhame, hide any thing that he hath made known to us, that may tend to the good of others, and was made known to us, to be made known to them; or if in adminiſtring it, we uſed fleſhly wiſdom or policy, reſerving much of that which might moſt expoſe us to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, though moſt material &amp; needful to be moſt plainly uttered, or for other cauſes reſerving the inſide of our thoughts and meaning to our ſelves &amp; ſo handling the word of God deceitfully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; happily to ſuch ends following cunningly-deviſed fables, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16. But this, ſaies he, we have renounced; and thus they lived honeſtly among their neighbours, and thus have they by the mercies of God charged and exhorted every one of us ſo to live amongſt men, according to what capacity and opportunity God gives us. See 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3 11, 12. When he hath told them their <hi>Exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncle anneſs, nor in guile; but as they were allowed of God ſo they ſpake; not as pleaſing men, but God, which tryeth the hearts:</hi> and further addes and appeals to their conſciences for teſtimony, <hi>They had not uſed flattering words, nor a cloke of covetouſneſs, nor had ſought glory of men, or been burthenſome, when, and as they might as the Apoſtles of Chriſt:</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in walked holily, juſtly, unblameably: he then addes this, <hi>As alſo you know how we exhorted every one of you, even as a father his child,</hi> &amp;c. like that <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13, 15, 16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1, 2. Yea, this grace teaches that as our reaſonable ſervice, to hold forth this faithful word in converſation, that they that will not be won by the word, and it may be not to hear it, as holden forth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118359:50"/>
by believers under reproach, yet may be allured and overcome by the chaſte and honeſt converſation coupled with fear; <hi>When they ſee our good works, they may glorifie our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Therefore to ſhew forth his vertues in all chaſtity or honeſty, as oppoſed to fornication and all uncleanneſs, filthineſs, or fooliſh talking or jeſting, <hi>Eph. 5. 2, 3. 1 Theſſ. 4. 3. 4, 5. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 11, 12. and ſo as oppoſed to covetouſneſs which is idolatry, and the fruits thereof, fraudulency, or endeavouring to go beyond or circumvent any in buying ſelling, or the like, as in the forecited Scriptures; and ſo in all ſobriety and moderation in the uſe and enjoyment of any thing of this world, as ſtrangers and pilgrims, or in luſting and purſuing after them, fleeing from ſuch things; yea, in all goodneſs, righteonſneſs and truth, which is, and as it is the fruit of the Spirit, bringing and opening the inſtructions and grace of the Goſpel, leading and moving thereto. And this cordially alſo, in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, and for the profit of others, that they may be ſaved. All this is but out reaſonable ſervice by the mercies of God, even towards all men: though they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther challenge the greateſt part of this debt of us, nor any of it upon ſuch an account, nor will they reſpect or look upon our ſervice as ſuch; yet as that man that is betruſted with much trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or the tidings, diſcoveries, and patterns of it, that belongs, and is to be ſhewed to others, of purpoſe to let them know of it, and where and how they may come to enjoy it, though they to whom ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and the tidings or patterns of it belong and ought to be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, being ignorant, though happily wilfully ſo, do not deſire or expect any ſuch thing from him, nor happily will eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to accept or regard the ſame, though matter of greateſt concernment to them; yet ſeeing he knows of what concernment it is, and to what end he is furniſhed with the knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> experience, and patterns of it, as a Steward for them; he is not an honeſt man, or faithful Steward if he conceal the ſame, but very injurious; <hi>'Tis required of Stewards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a man be found faithful,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 2. Even ſo thoſe that are called out of darkneſs into his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light, that they ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him that hath called them, and that amongſt and for the good of others; though thoſe among whom they live, neither acknowledg it, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, yet are to proſecute it as their main deſigne, to give them that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:118359:50"/>
which is due to them; namely, To let them know of, and ſee the grace of God in Chriſt towards them, and the inſtructions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs thereof in the tidings and patterns of it, according to capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and opportunity given them, and therefore to abſtain from fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, and to deny themſelves in whatever might hinder them; as the grace of God in Chriſt, that brings ſalvation to all men, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, for the good of others; and in ſo doing ſhall live honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>Theſe two, godlineſs and honeſty, are anſwerable to thoſe two great Commands, on which hang all the Law and the Prophets: (the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to all men requiring and affording motive and motion to the ſame) <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy minde, with all thy ſoul, with all thy ſtrength.</hi> The ſecond is like unto it, a Spring or Fruit of it: <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Yea, theſe are contained and found in thoſe two great Commands of the Goſpel, which it gives ground for, and moves to, and writes in the heart of the believing receiver of it: To believe on the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in which the Father is believed in, loved, and ſo rightly worſhipped, as is foreſhewn. The other is like unto it, and indeed but the Fruit of it, and part of the ſame Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore both are called one Commandment, 1 <hi>John 3. 23. That we love one another, as he</hi> by the grace of the Goſpel obligeth, and <hi>hath given us Commandment.</hi> And ſo this living in godlineſs and honeſty anſwers to, and gives explication of that <hi>chap. 1. 18. Holding faith and a good conſcience;</hi> which are begotten and ingendered, and we ſtrenghthened to hold faſt and walk in them, through his grace, as declared in that name of his in his Son, in our looking, ſeeking, or adhering to it, according as by that grace extended, we are directed and ſtrengthened.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118359:51"/>
found: <hi>This is the generation of them that ſeek him, that ſeek thy face, O God of Jacob:</hi> now the glorious face of God is clearly manifeſted in the face of his Son, as delivered to death for our offences and raiſed again for our juſtification: and in ſeeking, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, or beholding his face as there revealed in righteouſneſs, the heart is therein ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and the body waſhed with pure water, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. the heart purified through obedience to the truth, to unfeigned love of God and Brethren. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. For therefore hath God condemned ſin in the fleſh, in condemning his Son in the fleſh for ſin, that the righteouſneſs of the Law, not onely life and peace the end of it, but even the righteous affections and ſervices towards God and men which it required, but gave no ſtrength to perform, might be fulfilled in them who walk not after the fleſh, conſulting with it, or minding the things of it; but after the Spirit, that bears witneſs of, and glorifies Jeſus, and the glory of God as in the face of him; and ſo ſuch uſe of the Law is good, as is according to and taught by that glorious Goſpel, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 11, 15. Thus having ſeen what that is in which the believer is continually to be exerciſed and lead his life, as here expreſſed under theſe terms, In all godlineſs and honeſty; We come here to conſider, How in this exerciſe, not neglecting, wavering or ſhrinking from it, but in all godlineſs and honeſty, the grace of God teaches them, and for the good of others, to lead a quiet and peaceable life.</p>
            <p>Quietneſs and peaceableneſs, is ſometime oppoſed to timerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, doubtfulneſs and haſtineſs; and ſignifies, quietneſs, patience, and confidence in waiting for the accompliſhment of Gods word, and his own bringing to paſs the good things he hath promiſed in his own time and way, without making ſuch unreaſonable haſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is unſuitable to believing in God for the accompliſhment of his word; as ſometimes <hi>Abraham</hi> began to do, in concluding <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazer</hi> to be his heir; and after, in taking <hi>Sarahs</hi> advice, to go in to his Maid; and then becauſe that brought forth ſomething ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their expectation, concluding preſently, that birth of the wiſdom and ſtrength of the fleſh was the promiſed ſeed; in this ſence quietneſs is to be underſtood in that counſel to <hi>Ahaz, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted:—if ye will

Yea, he that truely hopes for thoſe things he ſees not, will with patience wait for them: it is to be feared, our hopes are for ſome ſenſual glory, as if Chriſts Kingdom were of this world; and that makes us imagine and ſtrive by ſenſual means, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weapons to bring it about: and having no ground for ſuch hope in the word of the truth of the Goſpel, (though did we believe it, we might there have good ground for that which is infinitely better) we are alſo making haſte, and catching at every thing we ſee, and ready to conclude, Lo here is Chriſt, or there is Chriſt; in this part of the world, or in that; in this form of Government, or in that; and many the like. We muſt needs be in a confuſion, when there is ſcarcely found faith confidently to expect, and quietly to

            <p>Quietneſs and peaceableneſs in our demeanor towards men, is ſometimes oppoſed to much noiſe, clamour, or ſtir, that is made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in proclaming mens own goodneſs, or in crying up this and that Order, Worſhip or Precepts of men, or in crying down and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring others; ſo in that <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>The words of wiſe men are heard in quiet,</hi> (when there are no ſuch tumultuous noiſes ſtirred up) <hi>more then the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</hi>

The quiet and peaceable life that is according to godlineſs and honeſty, and to which we are inſtructed in the Goſpel and grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as with reference to thoſe that by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are in eminent place or in authority over us, whether as particular Maſters, or as publique Magiſtrates, Standeth in a quiet ſubmiſſion or ſubjection to their power, living under it without murmuring or diſputing againſt it diſturbance, moleſtation, or reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. My buſineſs is not here to diſpute what believers as publique men, ſet in any publique place of truſt and authority for the good of the Nation or people where they live, may or ought to do, with reference to ſome others in place of truſt and authority with them; nor what any private Chriſtian, as joyned in a politick or national body, or required and ſo called out by ſome higher powers, may or ought to do with reference to ſome other powers or perſons in authority, that are oppreſſive or deſtructive to them. About theſe, I ſay, I have not here to diſpute or ſpeak: but how believers as private Chriſtians, in their ſeveral places, or as members of, or joyned in any Societies or Congregations, if never ſo many, for and in the worſhip and acknowledgement of God, and waiting upon, and ſervice of him as Chriſtians in his Ordinances, and for the good of others; (for ſo alſo they are conſiderable as private Chriſtians, and to live under Government) and how they are to be in ſubjection, and to demean themſelves with reference to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours or Magiſtrates by Gods providence ſet over them, is that we have here to ſpeak to.</p>
            <p>1. They are to account and acknowledge them worthy or meet for all that honour, thoſe places of truſt and authority over them, that God hath pleaſed by his providence to put upon them, or permit unto them; and ſo in their demeanour to teſtifie ſuch their account and acknowledgement of them. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Let as many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as are under the yoke, count their maſters,</hi> (though unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ones, as is fully ſignified, by comparing this with the next verſe) <hi>worthy of all honour:</hi> of all that honour that by their place is due from us to them. It's the ſame in the caſe between the people, and ſo believers as private Chriſtians, and their Governours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. And herein they are every ſoul to be ſubject to thoſe powers that be (that at any time at preſent are over them) without diſpute about the lawfulneſs or rightneſs of their being ſet
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118359:53"/>
up there; they being by Gods providence or permiſſion in ſuch place of maſterſhip or authority over them, they are to yeild them that fear, honour, reverence and acknowledgement, that by reaſon of the place in which God hath ſet them, is due to them, and account it meet it ſhould be ſo, becauſe God ſees it good, and in his infinite wiſdom hath ordered the ſame to us. And if their Maſters or Governours be believers, then neither are other believers, as private Chriſtians, Servants or Subjects to deſpiſe them, becauſe they are brethren, as if therefore they ſhould not yeild them ſuch reſpect, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and acknowledgement as is due to them by their place of truſt and power put in their hands, becauſe they are brethren and all one in Chriſt; for grace deſtroys not nor confounds either natural or civil relations. It's according to the wiſdom of God, that there ſhould be ſuch degrees among men, as the Rulers and Ruled, Maſter and Servant, and that for the order, benefit and good of them all. Therefore the rather do them ſervice, and yeild them all the honour due according to their place, becauſe they are faithful and beloved. And if any man teach otherwiſe, he therein conſents not to the words of our Lord Jeſus, nor to the doctrine which is according to godlineſs; yea, ſuch are proud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this therefore conſider,</p>
            <p>1. That it is by the wiſdom and power of God, as exerciſed in and through Chriſt for the good of men, which otherwiſe it could not have been, <hi>That Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice: that Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth,</hi> Prov. 8. 15, 16.

we have learned in Jeſus inſtructeth and leadeth us; that is ſo far from being the meekneſs and gentleneſs of Chriſt, that it is on the other hand, ungodlineſs, diſhoneſty, and a ſhunning the Croſs of Chriſt: yet in doing the work of an Evangeliſt, or holding forth the faithful word, and ſhewing forth the vertues of Chriſt, and that both in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, with diligence and conſtancy, we are therein, and according thereto, to ſhew forth all meekneſs to all men, gentleneſs eaſineſs to be intreated, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 13, 17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. For the wrath of man works not the righteouſneſs of God, and therefore we are to avoid fooliſh and unlearned queſtions, and ſtrife of words, which tend to no profit, but to the ſubverting of the hearers from a right and plain underſtanding, knowing that they do gender ſtrifes; and the ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient in meekneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the ignorant and them that oppoſe themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 23. 25. and ſo therein patiently enduring and ſuffering, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods chaſtiſements, his gracious afflictions more immediately ordered from his own hand; but alſo their wrongs and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: <hi>Let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour, for his good to edification: for even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf; but as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell on me,</hi> Rom. 15. 2, 3. which in the place where it is written, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 9. is joyned with this other ſaying, <hi>The zeal of thine houſe hath eaten me up:</hi> which is applied to, and ſaid to be verified in his driving the buyers and ſellers out of the temple; in which acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (mentioned <hi>John</hi> 2. 14, 17, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) he did not directly pleaſe them, but as may appear by the Evangeliſt compared with the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> did therein render himſelf and became a ſtranger to his brethren, <hi>&amp;c.

pleaſed them for their good to edification, in not regarding or ſeeking in any of theſe things to pleaſe himſelf, or to glorifie and get honour and praiſe to himſelf among them; doing nothing through ſtrife and vain-glory, but in lowlineſs of minde preferring them before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in giving honour to them, ſo as in tendering of them, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their evil manners, enduring their contradictions quietly and patiently, ſuffering them without reviling again: he in all his zeal and conſtancy for his Fathers name and glory, yet therein pleaſed not himſelf, <hi>but as it is writien, The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me:</hi> and he willingly without ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or retorting bore and ſuffered them.

each, and ſo in their ſeveral adminiſtrations, as well as in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, Faith and Fellowſhip in thoſe things forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, in which there is ſuch abſolute oneneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The unity of the Spirit is to be endeavoured to be kept in the bond of peace,</hi> Eph. 4. 3, 7. with 1 Cor. 12.

So <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Be kindly affectioned one to another with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, in honour preferring one another: look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others,</hi> Phil. 2. 3, 5. <hi>Looking diligently, leſt any man fail of the grace of God, leſt any root of bitterneſs ſpringing up trouble you, and there by many be defiled,</hi> Heb. 12. 15, 16. which roots of bitterneſs, envies, evil ſurmiſes, and ſuch-like may be occaſioned divers wayes; as ſometimes by partiality or reſpect of perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong brethren generally, or with reference to ſuch inſtruments, as by whom the word of the Lord hath been brought or opened to us; as when one ſaith, I am of <hi>Paul;</hi> another, I am of <hi>Apollo;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I am of <hi>Cephas;</hi> which occaſions ſome to run out in another extream, and they will not onely be of neither of theſe, but they will be of Chriſt immediately, and as not needing, or looſe from any of their brethren or ſuch inſtruments. Therefore the Apoſtle admoniſhing the <hi>Theſſalonians, To know them which are over them in the Lord, and admoniſh them, and to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſakes;</hi> he addes, <hi>And be at peace among your ſelves,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 12, 13. And how they may be ſo in obſerving the forementioned counſel, he explicates, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17, 21. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118359:57"/>
worthy of double honour, eſpecially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> It follows, <hi>I charge thee before God, and the elect Angels, that thou obſerve theſe things without prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one before another, doing nothing by partiality</hi> (namely, in the things forementioned, as well as alſo in thoſe things mentioned <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. 20.) <hi>Againſt an Elder receive not an accuſation, but before two or three witneſſes: them that ſin</hi> (eſpecially of the Elders, or ſuch as ſhould go before others in the word of the Lord:) and in things common and publick, tending to publick ſcandal or harm, and being ſo convict as aforeſaid, or it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appearing:) <hi>rebuke before all, that others alſo may fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe ſuch roots of bitterneſs and breach of the peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, may be occaſioned through too harſh cenſuring or judging one another, in the doing or not doing things that are in themſelves ſo circumſtantial, and may be either done or let alone, as that eating or not eating, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. or in the manner of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of ſome of Gods Ordinances. Therefore the Apoſtle coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 20. whatever things they are in which the Kingdom conſiſteth not, as righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, are the things in which it doth conſiſt, and in which he ſaith, He that conſtantly and ſtedfaſtly ſerveth Chriſt, is acceptable to God, and profitable to men; for any other thing, he would not have us be ſtiff, or earneſt to bring men to our practice, until grace ſet free thereto; nor in judging them if they joyne not with us, leſt ſo we deſtroy the work of God; but on the other hand, to <hi>follow after thoſe things that make for peace, and things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with one may edifie another.</hi> And in ſo doing, if in any thing the whole or part be otherwiſe minded then is right, God ſhall in due time reveal even that unto them. Nevertheleſs whereto we have attained through the light and inſtructions of the Goſpel, that Viſion of all, the Key of knowledge for the opening all particular Precepts and Ordinances; Let us walk or go an end by the ſame Rule, not lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down any of his Ordinances, becauſe others cannot joyne with us in them: though we may and are to lay down any thing meerly indifferent, and ſo any thing circumſtantial in Ordinances, as to the maner of obſervance, as far as is indifferent, and may be without evil, when and as it may be for the greateſt good of our brethren,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118359:57"/>
and to avoid offence; yet not to throw by any of his gracious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, but to go on in ſuch obſervance of them as grace teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, minding the ſame thing, without ſeverity or rigidneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or judging of our brethren that are ſcrupulous in many of the things we do. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 14, 15. Divers other occaſions we might have mentioned of diſturbing and breaking the peace among believers, which therefore as, well as becauſe they are otherwiſe hurtful, and in themſelves very evil, we are admoniſhed of; as idleneſs, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tatlers, buſie-bodies, not diligently, and ſo as may be in and with fervency of Spirit ſerving the Lord, minding their own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; that (after any conſideration in ſpiritual or temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires) which God by his providence layes before them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inſtructions of the Goſpel requires of them, but being ſlothful and negligent therein, and medling with the matters of others, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 11. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 6, 10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 13, 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15. Thoſe exhortations are to this purpoſe good and needful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9, 10, 11. as alſo they have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the foregoing verſes; likewiſe readineſs to entertain or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour evil reports or thoughts of others, or keeping in minde the weakneſs, evils, or things injurious to us, found in any of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; with many the like, (which I ſhall not particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) will be occaſions of diſturbing the peace and quiet of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in all godlineſs and honeſty among themſelves. To conclude therfore, I may ſay as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Finally,</hi> that our prayers for all men, for our ſelves and others be not hindered, <hi>Be all of one minde, having compaſſion one of another, love as brethren, be pittiful, be courteous,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Let all bitterneſs, wrath, clamour and evil ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice; and be ye kinde one to another, tender hearted, forgiving and forbearing one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you:</hi> who did forbear and walk tenderly towards you, before you did acknowledge any evil, and until by his goodneſs you were moved thereto; and then gave you forgiveneſs, &amp; entertained you into fellowſhip again without upraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>And let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain-glory, nor in hypocriſie, or with partiality,</hi> Eph. 4. 31, 32. Phil. 2. 3 4. Rom. 12. 9, 11. Jam. 3. 17. <hi>That ſo you may be at peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your ſelves; for God is not the Author of confuſion, but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118359:58"/>
of peace,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 33. Thus having ſeen what it is for the <hi>believer to lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty;</hi> We come in the next place to conſider,</p>
            <p>2. How the believers leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty, tends ſo much to the good of all men. We ſhall ſhew it in theſe two things,</p>
            <p>1. It tends much to the believers own advantage, profit, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture for the good of others.</p>
            <p>2. It tends to the adorning the name and doctrine of our God and Saviour, and ſo manifeſting the truth and goodneſs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and way of it before them.</p>
            <p>1. This tends much to the believers own advantage, furtherance and growth in grace, and in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, which is for the good of all, and to be made to appear unto them. Therefore the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy, To exerciſe himſelf to Godlineſs, to give himſelf wholly to theſe things, that he might be a good miniſter to others, by growing himſelf; being nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed up in the words of faith, and of good doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he had attained, that his profiting might appear to all; for in doing this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou ſhalt ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 6 7, 15, 16. Great is the gain of godlineſs, if the believer walk honeſtly in it, and be content with what he hath, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6, 11. It's the way in which the believer ſhall certainly meet with ſtrength againſt, preſervation and deliverance from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of Satans temptations, and his ſnares laid, in ſomething or other of this world, after which we are naturally luſting, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 10, 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7, 8, 9. Yea, Satan will be herein deprived of the opportunity he deſires for getting advantage over us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2, 10, 11. This I ſay then, Walk in the Spirit, in the light, inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, motion, and direction of the Spirit, which is in and with the teſtimony of Jeſus; and of the glory of God as manifeſted in the face of him, taking and ſhewing of the things of him, and ſo lifting up and glorifying him; and ſo by that Viſion of all, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into all truth, inſtructing and directing to and in all godlineſs and honeſty: <hi>Walk in the Spirit,</hi> if we live in it, <hi>and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5. 16. Yea, it's the way by which we ſhall get more victory, and be dayly more inſtructed and ſtrengthened to turn from thoſe idols of iniquity ſet up in our
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118359:58"/>
hearts, (that hinder our Prayers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14, 4, 7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7.) and to wait for his Son from Heaven, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3 9, 10. and ſo meet with ſaving to the utmoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1. 3 4. <hi>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God?</hi> 1 John 5. 4, 5. <hi>Whoſe keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected,</hi> 1 John 2. 5. <hi>Therefore thy word have I hid in my heart,</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> And again, <hi>Order my ſteps in thy word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me,</hi> Pſal. 119. 11, 133. For by that Law of liberty, or joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound, as then witneſſed in the Law, Oracles, and Prophets, was he warned; and in keeping thereof had great reward, as to the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and purging out ſecret iniquity, and preventing preſumptuous tranſgreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. Yea, hereby theſe things being in us and abounding, a more abundant entrance ſhall be adminiſtred to us, into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour. Yea, <hi>they will make us, that we ſhall be neither barren nor unfruitful therein; but he that lacketh theſe things is blinde, and cannot ſee afar off, and hath forgoten that he was purged from his old ſins,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 11. <hi>In abiding and walking in Jeſus Chriſt, as we have received him, we ſhall grow more rooted in him, and built upon him, eſtabliſhed in the faith as we have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving,</hi> Col. 2. 6, 7. For being juſtified by faith, (of what Jeſus Chriſt hath done, and is become in himſelf for us, by being delivered to death for our offences, and raiſed again from the dead for our juſtification:) and ſo having peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we have alſo by him through the ſame faith in him, according to his name, dayly more acceſs into that grace of God to manward, appearing in and through that gift of Righteouſneſs, (which was that grace in which they ſtood) ſo as to be made able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the height, length, depth, and breadth of that love that paſſeth knowledge, and more to prove and taſte the ſweetneſs and vertues of it; and ſo through it to rejoyce in hope of the glory of God; and not onely ſo, but to rejoyce in tribulations alſo, (meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this knowledge and proof of the truth of it, in having dayly acceſs or inlet into that grace) <hi>That tribulation works patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118359:59"/>
hope makes not aſhamed; and all from hence, the love of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhed abroad in our hearts:</hi> while we have our recourſe and acceſs thereinto, by a believing mindefulneſs thereof in all things, the ſame is more diſplayed and opened to us, <hi>by the holy Ghoſt which is given unto us;</hi> ſtill further reminding us of, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us this teſtimony of Jeſus, <hi>That when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly.</hi> Rom 4. 24. with chap. 5. 1, 6. Therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words in you, continue in my love, keeping my Commands, &amp;c. ye ſhall ask what ye will; and it ſhall be done unto you;</hi> (for thereby you ſhall be taught to pray as you ought, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26.) for nothing but according to his will, (1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 13, 15.) and for that <hi>without wrath or doubting,</hi> (1 Tim. 2. 1, 8.) Yea, <hi>and ye ſhall bring forth much fruit; and herein is my Father glorified,</hi> John 15. 1, 6, 8, 11. And this leads us to the next.</p>
            <p>2. The believers leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honeſty, tends very much to the adorning the name and doctrine of God our Saviour, and to the manifeſting the truth and goodneſs of his Goſpel and Way before them. Hence that is one great end propounded, to move Servants to ſuch demeanor towards their Maſters, and every Soul to the higher powers; and ſo all Chriſtians in their ſeveral places towards one another, and towards all men, as is according to godlineſs and honeſty, <hi>Even as that grace of God that brings ſalvation to all men teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That the name of God and his doctrine be not blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 1. <hi>That they may adorne the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things,</hi> Tit. 2. 10. <hi>That ye may be blameleſs, harmleſs, the Sons of God without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked generation; amongſt whom, ſhine ye as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life,</hi> Phil. 2. 15, 16. <hi>And that ſo, as men ſeeing your good works may glorifie your Father; the Gentiles in the day of their viſitation may glorifie God,</hi> Mat. 5. 13, 16. 1 Pet. 2. 12. And this general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, a full direction in every caſe, <hi>Onely let your converſation be ſuch as becometh the Goſpel,</hi> Phil. 1. 27. For a little demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, ſee it in ſome particulars.</p>

being ſubject to the higher Powers as ordained of God over him, yea, though there be no ſuch juſtice or righteouſneſs iſſuing from them as he could deſire, as well as in other parts of ſuch demeanor as is forementioned; he declares plainly to others thereby, That the grace of God in Chriſt inſtructs and leads to ſuch high eſteem of the infinite wiſdom, goodneſs, and faithfulneſs of God, that <hi>hath not ſpared his own Son, but delivered him up to death for us all, and that in due time:</hi> and to ſuch aſſurance that the ſame wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, goodneſs, truth and faithfulneſs, is exerciſed in all his order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and diſpenſations towards us; according to that ſtanding teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of it in his Son, whom he hath given to be a continual wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his love and glory, in the exerciſe of all his holy attributes for our good, in all his dealings with and about us, and in ordering to us mercies and chaſtiſements, that though by ſence in moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular matters, at preſent it be not ſo diſcernable, yet by faith in him we may be helped to keep ſuch right judgement at all times, and from ſuch right judgement, taught and ſtrengthened to all things through him; and ſo for the Lords ſake that hath done ſo much for us, willingly ſubmit to any Power or Ordinance of men, that God by his providence orders over us, and that either in doing or ſuffering ſo as in the Lord, as judging that place and condition of ſervitude, and under ſuch a maſter or power, to be at the preſent the beſt for us, moſt ſeaſonable for the accompliſhing of Gods will, in either mercy or chaſtiſement for our good. And ſeeing his will is good and acceptable towards us in both, (as manifeſted in his Son) that grace inſtructs not to be ſolicitous or haſtily inquiſitive to know, whether for one or for another it be ſo ordered, yet quietly to wait for that alſo; that as he is by grace enabled to underſtand or perceive it, ſo he may receive and minde others of the inſtruction ſuitably in it; conſidering, that it is the great Maſter of us and them that is in Heaven; yea, it's he that gave his Son to the death for us, and now governs all things by his word; and in the ſame exerciſe of wiſdom grace, and faithfulneſs in and through his Son, that hath ordered to us ſuch an inferiour Maſter or Government, and us to ſuch place of ſubjection. Hence in thoſe particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations as to this matter, we are ſo oft exhorted to do the honour and ſervice, and yeild the ſubjection to them, as to the Lord, the great Maſter that hath ſo ordered them over us, to be ſubmitted to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118359:60"/>
by us; and not as to men, or as men-pleaſers; kowing that it's he that pulls down and ſets up at his pleaſure; <hi>And for this cauſe to pay tribute alſo, for they are Gods Miniſters.</hi> Servants and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, permitted and ordered over us by him, <hi>attending continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon this very thing; render therefore to all their dues,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as unto the Lord,</hi> and ſo in ſubmiſſion and reverence to the great Maſter in Heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 22, 23. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. hallowing his name:</p>
            <p>2. Herein alſo, as likewiſe in thoſe other branches forementioned of leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty, he plainly declares, That whatſoever good thing any man doth, in either ſervice or ſuffering for his name ſake, or for the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, this grace doth and will inſtruct them to know and aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect, they ſhall receive their reward from the hand of their great Maſter the Lord, that hath ordered them to ſuch ſervice; and ſo ſhall others for the wrong they do, whether Bond or Free, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or Governour, <hi>for there is no reſpect of perſons with God:</hi> and therefore to be patient &amp; contented, though ſuch reward be not equally adminiſtred from the hands of men; yea, to rejoyce in the glory to be revealed, expect and wait for the kingdom to come, and therein and then, look for the great and total ſalvation of all thoſe that love and wait for his ſecond appearing, who ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly appear to their glory, and then render every man according to his work; and therefore not to ſeek great things, as glory, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or eaſe and freedom from trouble in this world; but to be contented here to ſerve and ſuffer, as thoſe longing and yet pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently waiting for his appearing; knowing that when their Lord comes, and all his Saints with him, they ſhall ſit down with him in his kingdom, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 7 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 23, 24, 25. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>

            <p>3. The believer being adorned with ſuch demeanor as aforeſaid, further declares or manifeſteth, That ſuch is the great ſatisfaction and conſolation that is found and met with in Jeſus Chriſt, in the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mindefulneſs and conſideration of him, according to that which is already done in and by him, to make way for the goodneſs of God to be extended, in and through all his dealings; and as a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witneſs (as before) in which the name of God is ſo gloriouſly declared, and in minding alſo the hope laid up for them in Heaven.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118359:60"/>
as they have been inſtructed in it, in the word of the truth of the Goſpel; and ſo in that expectation and looking for it, begotten in them from the conſideration of that already done; yea, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of this life and that to come, given them in Chriſt, appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to godlineſs; ſuch the comfort and encouragement of Gods love therein met with, ſuch the fellowſhip of the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in enjoyed, that theſe waters being drunk, will and do certainly and abundantly preſerve from thirſting after other waters, and make careleſs of themſelves or their own things; yea, willing to lay down and deny themſelves in any thing, that his will may be done, and for the proſecuting the great deſigne that is according to it, the one thing needful for our ſelves and others, more knowledge of and conformity to his grace; and therefore cheerful in whatever we may ſuffer therein; and knowing that the will of God is one and good, perfect and acceptable, this grace inſtructs and leads to deſire that may be done, and to rejoyce in the doing of it, or in it being done, though in things unpleaſing to the fleſh, even in tribulations, Great peace have they (it appears in ſuch demeanor as aforeſaid, not by ſence, but by faith;) that love Gods Law, nothing ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them; they manifeſt to all men, that that teacheth them, though free, yet not to uſe their liberty in Chriſt as a cloak of maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or pride; <hi>That ſo with well-doing, they may put to ſilence the ignorance of foliſh men,</hi> knowing that <hi>ſo is the will of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 13, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 119. 164, 165, 166. 2 Cor. 4. 15, 18. and 5. 1. 7.</p>
            <p>4. They likewiſe ſhew forth in ſuch their demeanor as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, how that grace teacheth them to account of themſelves as Strangers, Travellers and Pilgrims here, and that as thoſe that are ſeeking and looking for another and better Country, Kingdom and Glory, even one to come, the new Heavens and new Earth, in which dwells Righteouſneſs. They ſhould not, nor have cauſe to be mindeful of the Country out of which they are called, nor ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous or careful for the things of it, onely their dayly bread in it as he ſees good for them; that is, their Conductor and Leader in and through it; ſuch protection, accommodation and preſervation by the way, and according as every dayes need requires, and as may in the wiſdom of their Leader moſt tend to their furtherance in the journey, and their ſtrengthening and accommodation in their ſervice

and ſuffering for him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Seeking the Kingdom of Heaven and the Righteouſneſs thereof, not being careful in any thing elſe; but preſenting their needs and committing their matters to him, to adde all other things as he ſees good, and in a ſubſerviency to the main deſigne, and the great things of his love, to which is the deſire of the Soul in all. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 32, 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 5 6.</p>
            <p>5. They likewiſe manifeſt to all men in ſuch their demeanor, that this grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to all men, teacheth even the believers, To look at themſelves as great ſinners and very unworthy, and ſo much the more, as their evils are againſt ſuch grace conferred on them: and therefore have no cauſe to boaſt or lift up themſelves above others; but great need themſelves to come with them dayly to that common fountain, owning their evils, and ſeeking pardon and healing on the account of, and through that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, and prevalent mediation, which is alſo for others to come unto God with them by: and that the heart being ſeaſoned with the apprehenſion of Gods great goodneſs, and the infinite ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the blood of Jeſus, in ſo gracious pardoning, healing and helping them, that will make them, that they cannot be rigid towards or againſt others, and move them to be kinde, tender-hearted, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, as Chriſt hath forgiven them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 21, 33. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 32. And ſo alſo by ſuch love, ſo like to the love of God in Chriſt, and ſo expreſſed in ſuch lowlineſs and meekneſs, they are manifeſted before all men to be his Diſciples. And the name of God and his grace exceedingly magnified and commended in them: Yea,</p>
            <p>6. They do alſo by ſuch demeanor (as aforeſaid) teſtifie, That they are evermore by that grace of God in Chriſt minded, and in heeding of it made ſenſible of their own weakneſs, and the ſubtilty, evil, and poyſon of the temptations of Satan and the World; and therefore will not, nor dare preſumptuouſly ſin againſt God, in ruſhing into temptations, or willingly entangling themſelves with the occaſions of them, being inſtructed, warned, and awed by that grace to ſerve the Lord with fear, and though with rejoycing alſo, being made willing and cheerful in all their ſervice, through the ſweetneſs and powerfulneſs of the Arguments of his grace; and alſo confident, rejoycing in hope, and ſo patient in tribulation; yet
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118359:61"/>
thus to rejoyce before him with godly fear and trembling, and that for loves ſake, left they ſin againſt ſo good a God, knowing that ſo many are the occaſions within and without them, to entice and provoke them thereto, and ſo deprive themſelves of ſuch infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and of ſuch abundant entrance into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour, the enjoyment of which is ſet before them in and with Chriſt, and do therein alſo deprive others of the mercies they might and ſhould have by them, and therefore with this rejoycing in hope, and patience in tribulation, it inſtructs alſo to continue inſtant in Prayer; yea, withall to make no proviſion for the fleſh to avoid the occaſions and appearances of evil to flee from them as from death, leſt of them they ſhould reap corruption, and ſo be led into and overcome of the evil of the temptation. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 22. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9, 10. 11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10, 20, 22. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 16.</p>
            <p>All which Ornaments are put on in putting on Chriſt, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the motions and operations of the new man, (the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned judgement and diſpoſition or inclination of the heart, begotten and framed according to it) which after God is created in holineſs and righteouſneſs, through the truth as learned in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 17, 20. 21, 25, &amp;c. And do render the perſons ſo adorned, abundantly more meet to make their Prayers and Thanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings for all men, and to have their mouths filled with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of his goodneſs before them; they appearing while they are leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty, thus moulded in all theſe things to a right praying frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Spirit, and earneſtly and rightly ſet for the good of all, and profitably to proſecute it: and this adorning the doctrine of God our Saviour by the believer, being clothed with ſuch ornaments, and ſo ſhining as lights in the world, will prove a powerful and effectual means, to the drawing and alluring others to liſten to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and enquire after him with us. That which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> applies to the believing Wives, with reference to their unbelieving Husbands, we may alſo apply, or ſay the like concerning Believers in general, with reference to their unbelieving Neighbours, That even ſuch as <hi>obey not the word, might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word be wonne, by the converſation of the</hi> Believers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118359:62"/>
and towards them, while they behold their chaſte, upright or honeſt converſation coupled with fear, with godlineſs, awfulneſs, reverence and humility; whoſe adorning is not that outward, nor do they therein conform to the World, according to the former luſts in their ignorance, in plaiting of Hair, (changing any Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God hath given them, or priding themſelves with it) wearing of Gold, (ſignifying any coſtly Aray) or putting on of Aparel (be it never ſo mean, when they can get no better they may make that their Ornament; the neat or ſpruce putting on, or trimming themſelves with what they have:) compare with this 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15, 18. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11, 14. But their adorning is the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible: the fruits or operations of that which others ſee not appeares in their being adorned by it, and putting on the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, a thing in the ſight of God of great price; and ſo being clothed with humility, and filled with thoſe fruits of righteouſneſs that are by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Oh then let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity, by the mercies of God; let them go on, purging themſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and Spirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord, that they may be veſſels prepared for their Maſters uſe. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 7, 8, 19, 20, 22, 25. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10, 12, 14.</p>
            <p>Thus we have done with this firſt branch of the laſt general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction propounded; namely, we have ſhewed, That it tends very much to the good of all men, <hi>That believers lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty among them:</hi> we ſhall endeavour brevity in what follows.</p>

That therefore God likes it well in, and requires it of thoſe whom he ſets in Authority, or eminent place, places of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they ſhould all of them have a ſpecial eye at this, That his people that worſhip him, and would live quietly in the Land, that they may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty, under their protection and Government.

            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer: They can hardly ſo perfectly know them, as to diſtinguiſh them from all others that are like to them, eſpecially in theſe laſt days, there being ſo many that have ſpecious ſhews &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of godlineſs, by whom yet the power of it is denied; ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tares, that bring another and contrary fruit, that yet in their ſpringing up are ſo like the Wheat, that they can ſcarcely be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned or diſtinguiſhed from the Weat by the Servants, till by their fruit they appear. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 25, 26, 27. Likewiſe they when they are diſcerned, yet they are ſo mixed together with the Wheat, and growing ſo neer and like unto them, and ſeemingly from the ſame root or kernel, that they cannot be pluckt up without much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and detriment to the Wheat. There can be no Laws made, or courſe taken for the pulling out of the one, that will not tend to the infringement, diſturbance, if not rooting up of the other alſo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Servants of the houſholder, that as his Miniſters are Rulers in the Field of the World, at any time ſhould be ſuch as can
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:118359:65"/>
and do diſcern and diſtinguiſh between the Tares and the Wheat, and be aſſured of the rightneſs of their judgement according to the word of God the teſtimony of Jeſus; (which is the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) yet they are not to endeavour by their Laws, or in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Power and Authority to gather out the Tares, but let them alone alſo, and ſo let both grow together untill the time of the Harveſt, left they pluck up the Wheat alſo: <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. Yea, it is to be feared and hath been formerly found true, If they enterpriſe ſuch a work, they will pluck up more Wheat then Tares; <hi>Let them grow together therefore till the time of the Harveſt.</hi> And this counſel of our Saviour they may take, without learning that voluntary humility, under the pretence of charity, in which is ſomtimes more policy then grace, to own and acknowledge all that have any ſuch profeſſion, appearance, or forms of godlineſs, as the true Wheat, or godly Perſon, the right worſhippers, the one as contrary to another, at leaſt in the iſſue and fruit of their doctrines and wayes, as light is to darkneſs: if in liſtening to the teſtimony of Jeſus, and of the grace of God as manifeſted in him, which are the great things of his Law, they have been helped to underſtand and know the voice of the Son of God, the great and true Shepherd, and ſo where he feeds; which grace is much to be deſired and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after, in inquiring at the mouth of his teſtimony, as decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Goſpel, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7, 8. Then as by it they are alſo helped to diſcern and diſtinguiſh the voice of a ſtranger, they are not to follow it, but to avoid and have no fellowſhip with ſuch (as by the true light they diſcern to have a form of godlineſs, but deny the power thereof) in their unfruitful works of darkneſs, but rather reprove them, yea, to note them to others, and admoniſh them, <hi>To mark and avoid ſuch as cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which we have learned</hi> of the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: <hi>for ſuch ſerve not the Lord Jeſus, but their own luſt,</hi> appetite or will, <hi>and by good words and fair ſpeeches, deceive the hearts of the ſimple:</hi> and ſo to reprove them with all long ſuffering and doctrine according to their capacity, <hi>Joh. 10. 4, 5.

In the mean time it's his counſel to all the Servants, <hi>Let them both grow together,</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. All then that the moſt Chriſtian Rulers, or Magiſtrates, are capabable of doing in this matter for the Servants of God, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Kingdom in this World, and more is not required of them, is, to afford ſuch liberty, &amp; protection in that liberty, that believers <hi>may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty</hi> under them; which yet will be ſo, as the beloved among the daughters, many of which are as lions ſet on fire of hell; <hi>their teeth are ſpears and arrows, and their tongue a ſharpe ſword,</hi> Pſal. 57. 4.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118359:66"/>
Land, that he may cut off all wicked doers from the City of the Lord; pluck up all the Tares and every thing that offends, out of his Kingdom; all the hornes of the wicked he will cut off, and break them as a Potters veſſel, that can never gather together, or be made whole again: <hi>Then ſhall the World be eſtabliſhed,</hi> and ſetled in a ſtanding poſture, that it ſhall never be changed, moved or altered, nor the Government given to another people, for <hi>he ſhall judge the people righteouſly,</hi> Pſal. 96. 10. But it is the World to come, of which we ſpeak, which is fully to be in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto, and under the Government of Jeſus Chriſt: till then, there will be nothing but mutations: compare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 25, 26, 28. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10, 11. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 8. In the mean time, as no man is found capable of, or worthy to do ſuch things; ſo neither is it required of them; and the aſpiring at high things, or things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their ſphere, will prove very dangerous and deſtructive to them. <hi>Davids</hi> example and inſtruction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. is good for them to obſerve. It were well if they would obſerve Gods counſel in doing thoſe things they might do, and which he requireth of them, which according to the inſtructions of the Goſpel fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>conſidered, appears in this matter to be this:</p>
            <p>That Chriſtian Magiſtrates, or Rulers of the people, afford li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and protection as aforeſaid, unto all that do profeſs or pretend to deſire to worſhip, acknowledge, &amp; ſerve God in Chriſt according to his Word or Scriptures: I ſay, to defend and protect them in their worſhip and ſervice, if under ſuch pretence, and ſeeming or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion, they do not groſsly bleſpheme Him, his Son, his Word and Name, as therein plainly declared, ſo as they therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh and caſt off the outward acknowledgement of Him and his Name, as <hi>Levit. 24. 11, 16. Deut.</hi> 17. 1, 6. or if under ſuch pretences, or otherwiſe, they do not bend themſelves to do any thing wittingly, tending to the damage, injury, or harm of others, in body, eſtate or name, in vilifying or reproaching their perſons, or being otherwiſe injurious to them in ſuch things, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. 18, 23. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 11, 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16, 21. Thoſe things fall within the reach and power of the Magiſtrate to diſcern, and he is Gods Miniſter to execute wrath accordingly: yet even in ſuch things as thoſe, and with alluſion to thoſe very Scriptures, where it is written, <hi>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, (Levit. 24. 20.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:118359:67"/>
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 24.) our Saviour gives this general inſtruction to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as his Diſciples, That they ſhould not be ſtrict or exact in requiring ſuch reparation or ſatisfaction by way of equal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted by the Magiſtrate on them that did them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; but rather ſuffer wrongs, and paſs by injuries, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 38, 39, 40. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. according to the more abundant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to all men, in that appearance of it by Jeſus Chriſt, more abundantly inſtructing and leading to mercy, and quiet waiting for the reward after. And ſuch inſtructions being generally given to his Diſciples, may be of this uſe to Magiſtrates and Rulers, to inſtruct, that it is ſuitable to the full coming forth of the Goſpel and grace of Chriſt, that in their Laws of that nature there ſhould be proviſion for ſhewing more mercy; and in the execution of them, not ſuch ſtrictneſs and ſeverity as was under <hi>Moſes.</hi> At leaſt when and ſo as in ſhewing mercy, they may do nothing to the greater damage of others, in which the wiſdom of God will beſt inſtruct them. (But to return to our buſineſs.) If alſo under ſuch pretences of worſhipping God (as aforeſaid) or otherwiſe, they do nothing tending directly to the diſturbance of the peace of the Nation where they live, to the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſowing ſedition, or in contempt of the Authority ſet over them, and ſo uſing their liberty or pretence of liberty in Chriſt, for a cloak of pride &amp; maliciouſneſs ſo groſsly, if ſo, the Magiſtrate is Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to execute wrath for ſuch things, be they committed under what pretences they will, as may appear, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 5. compared with <hi>ch.</hi> 25. 8, 10, 11. where <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth, That the doing ſuch things, as ſome of them they charged him withall, as moving ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, offending againſt Authority, doing willingly any wrong to his Neighbour, had been worthy of death, or of bonds, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature and degree of the offence: ſo <hi>Peter</hi> ſignifies, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14, 15 16, 20. and 3. 9. 10, 11, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Otherwiſe they are to afford liberty and protection as aforeſaid, and ſo to all ſuch as are quiet in the Land; and in ſo doing, they ſhall certainly be a protection, defence and ſhadow, as the Night in the midſt of the Noon-day, unto Gods people that do rightly worſhip him, walking acording to the teachings of that grace that brings Salvation to all men, which teacheth them to lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty; ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection

they ſhall therein aſſuredly be to all ſuch, as under their Government they may more freely, chearfully and with enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though ſtill bearing the Croſs of Chriſt, lead ſuch quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty; which that they may do, God likes it well, and requires it of Governours, even all in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, further,</p>
            <p>2. That they ſhould, as publick Maſters or Magiſtrates, give unto thoſe under their Authority thoſe things that are juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, equally diſtributing juſtice, and throughly executing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between a Man and his Neighbour; conſidering, that they have a great Maſter in Heaven, that hath ſet them as his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to be a terror to evil works, a revenger of wrath on them that do evil, in thoſe things within their ſphear; to diſcern and judge which are eſpecially (if not onely) ſuch things, as in which one man ſins againſt another, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25. and ſo for the praiſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of them that do well. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 4. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 5. <hi>Take heed of decreeing unrighteous decrees, ſuch as are grievous and oppreſſive, and tend to turn away the needy from judgement, and to take away the right from the poor of the people,</hi> Iſa. 10. 1, 2. <hi>Oppreſs not the Stranger, the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Widow, ſhed not innocent blood, neither walk after other Gods, to your hurt,</hi> Jer. 7. 9. <hi>Truſt not in oppreſſion, become not vain in robbery,</hi> Pſal. 62. 10. <hi>

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118359:68"/>
diſturbance and moleſtation to them in their worſhip and ſervice of God; they have not the like opportunity or freedom to it in many reſpects that they ſhould have, if juſtice and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were throughly executed between a Man and his Neighbour: yea, many times by the oppreſſiveneſs of the Laws, and burthens on the people, and room left for inequality in the execution of them, it becomes a very hard and difficult matter, to live honeſtly a man with his Neighbour, or under the Authority. It's certainly evil, oppreſſive and deſtructive to the well-being of a Nation, when the Laws and Ordinances of men in it are ſuch, and ſo impoſſible to be honeſtly kept and ſubmitted to, that men are forced to break or ſin againſt them generally, that they may ſubſiſt in their way of honeſt Trade or Merchandize: beſides, it hinders the believer from that opportunity he ſhould have, for endeavouring the good of, and doing good to his Neighbour, according to his capacity.

By means of it, them that are in Authority ſhall have opportunity put in their hands, to take off the heavy yokes that make the oppreſſed to groan, and to ſee to the protection of ſuch as do well, and to have their eyes about them, with which they may ſcatter the wicked at home, and from about the Throne. Whether they will wiſely improve theſe opportunities to theſe purpoſes or no, that may be a queſtion; which if they do not, God will in his time take them from them again: <hi>For to him that hath, ſhall more be given; but from him that hath not,</hi> (or that retaineth or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth not) <hi>ſhall be taken, even that which he had,</hi> ſeeing he did not rightly uſe or improve it.

            <p>Againſt all this, ſome may happily ſay: We ſpeak as not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Viſions or Propheſies proper to theſe times, or which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118359:69"/>
are now to have their fulfilling, which (ſay they) ſpeak of the Saints deſtroying, conquering, and bringing under all their Enemies by the material Sword, and ſo taking and poſſeſſing the kingdoms of this World, and ſo Chriſt taking to him his great power and raigning in his people, and that by ſuch means, and in the time of this mortality: which conſidered, might encourage and put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all Chriſtians, the Rulers and Ruled together, to go on furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and confidently, without deliberate adviſement, yea, without preſident or rule, conquering and to conquer all that is before them, by their power and Sword, now while it is in their hand; and not to ſeek peace, but rather count it their honour, as Chriſtians or Saints, to be further imployed in war.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, we ſay, We cannot indeed boaſt as others do, of our underſtanding the Viſions of the times; but freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our great weakneſs and ignorance in them, as a fruit of our more fundamental ignorance in, or want of skill to make uſe of the Viſion of all Viſions, which is the Key of knowledge for the opening them, and whatever elſe is hard to be underſtood: nor deſire we at this time, much to lengthen our diſcourſe; (having been large in it already) yet briefly this we ſay, firſt, We read ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Viſions of theſe latter dayes opened by our Saviour in his anſwer to the Diſciples queſtion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 3. which queſtion had two things diſtinct in it, <hi>(viz.) When ſhall theſe things be,</hi> (namely, the things he had foretold about the deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and their Temple) <hi>and what the ſigne of his coming, and of the end of the world?</hi> It may ſeem the Diſciples thought, that the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and his ſecond appearing, and the end of the world ſhould have happened together; and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were not yet able to underſtand, or bear the hearing of another and longer time for his coming and the end of the world, then for the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> however, our Saviour anſwers to both the parts of the queſtion together: and though ſome of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular applicatory ſayings, by way of direction to them, (as <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, 20.) are with more peculiar reference to the firſt, which was to fall out in their day; yet all the predictions or things foretold to fall out, as fore-runners of both, are generally to be applyed to each; ſignifying, That the ſame things, and much in a like manner, that did fore-run the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhall alſo fore-run
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118359:69"/>
the ſecond appearing of Chriſt, and the end of the world; but ſtill more fully according to the predictions, as the laſt fulfillings of propheſies are alwayes the cleareſt and fulleſt. Now there we read that the Believers, the Saints of God, the Diſciples of Chriſt <hi>ſhall hear of wars, and rumours of wars:</hi> in that he mentions wars, as diſtinct from rumours of wars, in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> it's clear that by wars he means, ſuch as are neer them, in thoſe Nations and places where they live: but then in that of them, as well as of the rumours of wars in other places, he ſaith, They ſhall hear of them, he clearly ſignifies, That the Saints or Diſciples of Chriſt, (as ſuch) ſhall not be actors or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in them. It's none of their proper quarrel or fight for their kingdom, though there may be in them much of Gods quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt, and executing wrath or vengeance on many of their oppreſſors, by ſtirring them up one againſt another, or ſtirring up ſome againſt them, that may after prove ſuch themſelves under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother form; but the Saints or Diſciples of Chriſt, (whoſe work is not to avenge themſelves in this day; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 18, 19, 20.) they as ſuch are but Spectators, as Strangers and Pilgrims, looking on, and hearing the tumults and commotions between one and another, and wiſely conſidering the work of God therein, and lifting up their heads, for the nigh drawing of the day of their redemption, of which they know theſe are forerunners and ſignes, though they look not for it by this meanes: yet many of them, as part or members of the Nation where they live, may alſo be exerciſed on the defenſive part, or on that ſide where they underſtand good ground, and that warrantably, and may be eminently inſtrumental, more then other men, as in any national good work they joyn in; but not actors as Saints, either for their kingdom, or by way of revenge againſt any: for ſaith the Text, <hi>Nation ſhall riſe againſt Nation, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom againſt Kingdom,</hi> (not the Saints againſt the Nations or Kingdoms.) It follows, <hi>and there ſhall be earthquakes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, and famines, and peſtilences, and fearful ſights, and great ſignes from Heaven,</hi> Mat. 24. 7. Mark 13. 7.

cannot but do, knowing that it's generally true, That all wars and fightings come of mens luſts, <hi>&amp;c. Jam. 4. 1, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again we read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16, 17. of Gods putting it into the heart of the Kings of the Earth, (not Saints as Saints, but earthly Rulers and Governours) <hi>to hate the whore, and make her deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and naked, to eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire:</hi> but not that they ſhall then give their power unto Chriſt, or into the hands of the Saints, (they are not to come by it on that faſhion) but their power that was before in the whore, they ſhall eſtabliſh and give into the hands of the beaſt, the wordly power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, (which is a power ordained of God) until the words of God ſhall be fulfilled, which will not be by and by. There is ſome time for the ſpirit of Antichriſt to be revealed and lifted up, and that may be promoted by thoſe powers that deſtroyed his fleſh, or groſſer part: which yet if it ſhould be ſo, yet we know we have cauſe to acknowledge and thank God for his great goodneſs, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and power manifeſted and exerciſed towards his people, and for the good of all, in occaſioning ſuch enlargement and freedom from under bodily perſecution and reſtraint, by means of theſe wars and commotions, though they in themſelves be evil, and not to be deſired by us on any people: being indeed at leaſt the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his judgements and plagues for contempt of his Goſpel, and deſpiſing his people: yet out of theſe evils, they being but the beginnings of his judgements, God that is infinite in wiſdom, and wonderful in working, hath brought forth much good, and that for the good &amp; benefit of theſe Nations: we may ſay, Gods people have had more enlargement outwardly in divers conſiderations, to lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty, then is probable they could have enjoyed without theſe wars and commotions, God having begun here to make uſe of them, for burning the fleſh of the whore. We may ſay, God hath made them, and yet doth, as the Earth opening her mouth, and drinking up the floud that the Dragon ſent out of his mouth to deſtroy the woman, the deſpiſed Church of God here on Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 16. Even as when <hi>Saul</hi> was at the heels of <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> invading the Land, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned his ſudden taking off from his purſuit, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 26, 28. ſo we have ſeen, when in one generation of men, that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the titles of Lords over Gods heritage, the Dragon had ſent
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:118359:71"/>
out a great floud of perſecutions and Laws, to compel to commit fornication with the Whore. The beginning of theſe wars and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions in our Nations, tended to the drinking up the floud, and ſo helped the woman. And likewiſe when in another generation of men, that laid aſide the titles, but would have had and exerciſed the ſame power, and more binding over the conſciences of men, the Dragon had prepared to ſend out a floud of like and more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequence then the former; the continuance and oft renewing of the ſame wars, hath been opening the mouth of the earth, to the drinking up, or obſtructing the iſſuing out of that hitherto; and what they would yet do, if they could be ſetled by Authority in the power deſired by them, or what may iſſue forth by a third ſort or generation of men, whoſe eyes are lofty, and their eye-lids are lifted up, when ever things come to a ſettlement, and as they get leiſure and opportunity, we yet know not, or do not determine; though cauſe enough to ſuſpect, that Satan being angry with the Woman, becauſe he cannot have his will otherwiſe over her, will by them be making ſuch war as he can and finde out, new engines not ſo diſcernable, to be for that purpoſe, and therefore more dangerous, for the wearing out the poor remnant of her Seed, that keep the Commandments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus: as ſome hinderance to which, we ſee God makes uſe of the remaining wars and commotions, and not onely of them, but of the changes of his providences with us, pouring us from veſſel to veſſel: and from theſe conſiderations we cannot but ſee Gods great wiſdom and goodneſs to admire it, even in his terrible and ſtrange works towards the children of men; and may further learn with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and without murmuring, to ſubmit to his Government and wil. Yet for all this, the grace of God and the inſtructions of the Goſpel, do lead us, not to deſire the continuance of war and blood to our own or other Nations or people, any more then the ſame grace would have directed <hi>David</hi> to have deſired the continuance of, or the renewing the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> war upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe God made it an occaſion of good to him; but on the other hand, to deſire the welfare of all, and not the woful day to any; though ſometimes we are to pray for Gods aſhaming, confounding and blaſting them in their enterprizes, yet that ſo as may tend to their good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; to the good of every of them, until any be wholly given up of God, as before we

And ſo we may and are to deſire with ſubmiſſion to his will, for peace in our dayes and in our land, and more eſpecially where his name is, and with other Nations alſo; though happily when we have it, that which is for our welfare, may become a ſnare through mens abuſe of it, as before; yet ſeeing the thing is good in it ſelf, and a mercy to good ends given, it's therefore to be deſired and purſued by us, though with ſubmiſſion to his Appointment and Government; and Chriſtian Magiſtrates or Rulers, not to be provoked or ſtirred up to war with any other Nation or People, when they may have peace with them on any honeſt and juſt terms; but rather counſelled by the wiſdom of God: <hi>In the multitude of people is the Kings honor, but the want of people is the deſtruction of the Prince: he that is ſlow to anger is of great underſtanding,</hi> he is an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of God, and like to him, to which his grace that brings ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all men, now eſpecially obligeth ſince the appearance or coming forth of it by Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>For the Son of man came not to deſtroy m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To remember the law of Moſes his ſervant with the Statutes and Judgements:</hi> aſſuring them they had yet a time to wait for the accompliſhment of theſe promiſes; and that before the coming of this great and notable day of the Lord, he would ſend them <hi>Elijah, &amp;c.</hi> which had a firſt fruits of fulfilling in <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> ſent in the Spirit and Power of <hi>Elijah;</hi> but muſt be yet more clearly and fully accompliſhed to that people, (at leaſt) according to the expreſſions, a little before that ſecond and glorious appearing of Chriſt, <hi>To turn the hearts of the children to the fathers:</hi> ſo our Saviour as well ſaith, <hi>Elias verily cometh firſt,</hi> yea, <hi>muſt firſt come:</hi> as that he was then already come, <hi>and that was he, if they would receive him:</hi> (namely, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>) which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had they, and been turned to the Lord by him, there had not been that need for another accompliſhment of that Propheſie for that work: but they rejected him and the Lord too.

We may not further enlarge to this, onely this word: Notwithſtanding the day of the Lord draws nigh, and there is ſuch full demonſtration of it in the Goſpel, and of the bleſſed hope then, that were it minded, were enough to ſtabliſh the hearts of believers in their patient waiting for the coming of the Lord, even as the husbandman waiteth &amp; hath long patience for the precious fruit of the earth: yet ſtill we finde it needful, and now as much as ever, to preſs the Apoſtles exhortation, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2.

            <p>The Apoſtle, I ſay, having thus inſtructed them in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, makes uſe of theſe two things there diſcourſed of, namely, <hi>The glorious appearing</hi> or coming <hi>of our Lord,</hi> and <hi>Our being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together unto him,</hi> as the ground of his Argument, or as motives for the preſſing ſuch an exhorcation by way of uſefulneſs. <hi>Now we beſeech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not ſoon ſhaken in minde, or be troubled neither by ſpirit,</hi> (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of revelation) <hi>nor by word or letter as from the Apoſtles</hi> (by any doctrine, though pretended to be drawn from their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings) as there will be enough in theſe latter dayes, pretending to be ſeers of the viſions of the times, that will pervert things hard to be underſtood, to make them ſpeak out their apprehenſions; the Viſion of all, as plainly declared, being to them, and ſo rendered by them to others, as a ſealed Book. But we are to know, That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles have not intended in any of their writings, telling us that the day is nigh, and the like, to ſignifie any ſuch thing to us, as that the day of the Lord is otherwiſe at hand, then according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in the firſt chapter. That day of rendering vegeance on them that trouble us, and reſt to the troubled, is not ſo at hand, as to be made in this day, as ſome ſaid of the Reſurrection; or to come unto any before the Lord be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, and we be all gathered together unto him: which two things to be accompliſhed together, the Apoſtle ſets before us here by way of Argument or Motive, for the preſſing his exhortation; ſignifying to us, that there is ſo much ſweetneſs and conſolation to us in them, there being ſuch glory and excellency in the things themſelves, the glorious appearance of the Lord in that perſonal body glorified in our nature, in which he ſuffered for us, and hath through ſufferings obtained eternal Redemption, the faith of which (though yet we ſee him not with bodily eyes, nor do enjoy ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal fellowſhip with him) leads even now to rejoyce with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory; what will it be then to enjoy his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118359:75"/>
preſence, and immediate fellowſhip with him and the Father, and the holy Spirit, and ſo with him in his glory, (not in his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or abaſement, as ſometimes ſome did, but) in that glory, which he now actually poſſeſſeth in our nature, in his own perſonal body for us, even in the glory of his Father, and with his holy Angels, and we by that appearance to be changed even in our vile bodies, into the likeneſs of his glorious body, and ſo made capable of ſuch ſight of him as he is, and fellowſhip with him, and to be all ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together? not onely <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> but all that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him: ſurely we ſhall have good cauſe to ſay, Let us abide here, for this is our reſt to which we were called by the Goſpel; yea, and we ſhall be ever together with the Lord. Such, I ſay, is the excellency in the things themſelves, as well as alſo there is every way ſo much ſuitable inſtruction to inſtruct us, and give us reaſon to the matter of the exhortation, (of which we may not here particularly treat) that the conſideration thereof may and will frame us to willingneſs, to wait till then patiently for our ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down, and for the accompliſhment of the Propheſies and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as to the reward of all our ſervice and ſuffering for him; yea, not to part with that hope for any fancy, or ſhadow, or whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we are capable of enjoying in this day: <hi>Therefore comfort one another with theſe words,</hi> (ſaith this Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 14, 17.) and here by theſe things he thus earneſtly admoniſheth and beſeecheth them as before: and for further inſtruction about it, as well as eſpecially to give us a reaſon why he ſo earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth them, he further ſaith, <hi>Let no man deceive you by any means, for there ſhall be a great falling away firſt, and the man of ſin revealed,</hi> &amp;c. as if he ſhould ſay, as our Saviour doth, <hi>Therefore I ſo earneſtly admoniſh you to take heed, that no man by any means deceive you, becauſe the latter dayes will be ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous through the abounding of the myſtery of iniquity, under high forms and pretences of godlineſs, that verily there will many be deceived by them;</hi> yea, ſuch will be the tribulations of divers ſorts, though that the moſt eminent, trying, and dangerous, <hi>that if thoſe evil dayes</hi> (which will be by moſt pretending god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, accounted glorious dayes) <hi>ſhould not be ſhortened, no fleſh could be ſaved; but for the elects ſake they ſhall:</hi> and this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the latter inſtruction as a reaſon of the Apoſtles ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:118359:75"/>
in preſſing the admonition as aforeſaid, is ſuitable, not onely to that of our Saviour forementioned, but likewiſe to other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which (to mention the ſum of many) do therefore exhort and beſeech us with much earneſtneſs, to redeem the time, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all preſent opportunities and advantages, for being well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with wiſdom in the knowledge of him, and ſo with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God on the right hand and on the left, to be therefore ſober and vigilant, and watch unto prayer, becauſe the dayes are evil, and like to be perilous ſtill, as they grow nigher the end, in temptations tending to the deceiving and corrupting the believer from the ſimplicity that is in Jeſus, and patient waiting for his coming; and becauſe Satans rage is greater, as his time waxeth ſhorther, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14, 16, 18. and 6. 10, 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. with <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and 4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 16. and 2, 1, 2. If any do think, that we have not a great, or the greateſt part of that defection, or the overſpreading of the ſpirit of Antichriſt, the myſtery of iniquity there eſpecially ſpoken of, yet behinde, though it doth now already begin to reveal it ſelf, and not onely ſecretly to work, (as then) yet in reſpect of the more full revelation of him, and overſpreading of abomination by him, even to the further making deſolate the holy place, (as before in his body or groſſer part, to the deſolating the outward Court) as among us <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> to be more abundantly and fully verified. If any (I ſay) to this do think or ſay, Not ſo; I could be glad to ſay, Amen, if I could finde it ſuitable to the inſtructions and fore-warnings of the Goſpel: however, we may pray the Lord in mercy to cut ſhort thoſe dayes, for methinks the beginnings of them begin ſhrewdly to make deſolate; what will be the iſſue, eſpecially if Chriſt ans will not minde timely admonitions, but put far away the evil day? certainly theſe warnings are given, that we may take heed that no man deceive us. And were the premiſes conſidered, as it would be profitable to all Chriſtians, ſo particularly to Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, for their help and direction, in obſerving the forementioned counſels in every part of them; for were not the heart haughty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the eyes lofty, lifted up and tranſported with the apprehenſions and deſires of ſetting Chriſt on his Throne, which is a thing done already by the Father; or of laying the whole adminiſtration of Government upon his ſhoulders, which is a thing they are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:118359:76"/>
wholly uncapable of, neither is it required of them, or like things: they would then be contented, and better qualified to exerciſe themſelves in things within their compaſs, and might do many things for the good of the Nation and People under their Authority, which either they ſlight and neglect as things too mean, or too much beneath their ſpirits and apprehenſions, as to the work they aim at and propoſe to themſelves; or elſe they do refuſe whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appearance of legality and juſtice might be in it, becauſe it ſeems to croſs or claſh againſt ſuch their apprehenſions and propoſals to themſelves of what they have to do. I ſhall ſay no more to this, nor to this point; In which we have ſhewed what thoſe things are in general, that being equally obſerved and done by thoſe in Authority, will tend much to the believers enlargement and futher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>
            <p>4. We come now to the fourth and laſt conſideration: What that is, that will eſpecially furniſh them to theſe things, and ſo is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to be deſired for them, and that is wiſdom in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in Chriſt, as declared in the Goſpel, as now come forth to us, to have the heart well ſeaſoned with the believing, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and taſtes of the ſweetneſs of the infinite graciouſneſs of God to man-ward, as revealed in the face of Chriſt bringing ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all men, according to the manifeſtation and capacity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us. This is that one thing of abſolute neceſſity to us all, without which our ſouls cannot be good, or reconciled to God, <hi>Prov. 19. 2. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 22. nor can we rightly worſhip God, or ſerve him acceptably and profitably in our generation: <hi>Wherefore let us hold faſt grace,</hi> (Heb. 12. 28.) <hi>whereby we may ſerve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> exhorting all believers, and in the laſt place ſervants, to minde as the main end of their whole converſation, <hi>The adorning the doctrine of our God and Saviour in all things;</hi> he propounds to them, to be diligently heeded for their inſtruction and direction hereto, <hi>The grace of God that brings ſalvation to all men, as it hath now appeared, teaching us more fully and plainly then ever in any former appearance,</hi> (which is ſuitable to that <hi>Heb. 12. 17, 18, 22, 25, 28.) that denying all ungodlineſs and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this

And as here particularly Servants are directed to this, as that which will furniſh them to their ſuitable demeanor; So the ſame thing in ſum is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to Maſters, as a direction to that which may furniſh them to their ſuitable demeanor to their ſervants, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. after he hath given particular inſtructions to ſervants, ſuitable to thoſe in <hi>Titus;</hi> and then added this general one, to furniſh them to the obſervance of the particulars, <hi>That they do that which they do in ſingleneſs of heart as unto Chriſt:</hi> conſidering, how his grace both in that which he hath done for them, &amp; in the hope ſet before them by him in the Goſpel, teacheth them to demean themſelves, as in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſubmiſſion to him that hath ordered and appointed them to ſuch ſervice: Then he further addes, <hi>And ye maſters do ye the ſame things to them:</hi> that cannot be with reference to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars firſt mentioned; they are not as ſervants to obey their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as their ſervants them: but with reference to the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction added which he had laſt mentioned, in which is the key of knowledge for opening the reſt: <hi>Do ye the ſame things to them:</hi> that is, walk ye by the ſame rule, guide and direction, as ſervants unto Chriſt in your place, <hi>conſidering you have a Maſter in heaven,</hi> as Col. 4. 1. let the conſideration of him, his infinite wiſdom, goodneſs, power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in Chriſt exerciſed and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted towards, and over you and them, and the reward after, be ever with you for your direction. And what is thus applied in the caſe of Maſters and Servants, may in a ſuitable ſence be applied in the caſe of more publick Rulers and Ruled, as we have fore-noted from the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> his comparing and joyning them together, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and indeed, this was in all former ages looked upon by Gods Servants, as the onely great thing in order to all other things needful to be deſired for Kings and by them, as in <hi>Solomon, Give therefore thy ſervant an underſtanding or hearing heart to judge thy people, that I may diſcern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy ſo a great people? And the ſpeech pleaſed the Lord, that Solomon had asked wiſdom,</hi> 1 Kings 3. 8, 9, 12. and what wiſdom, <hi>David</hi> ſhews, even wiſdom in the knowledge of him the God of his Fathers, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. The great reaſon that <hi>the foundations of the earth are ſo out of courſe,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:118359:77"/>
is, becauſe the Rulers of it <hi>walk on</hi> (in all their counſels and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) <hi>in darkneſs,</hi> without the light and direction of that true light of the knowledge of the glory of God as now manifeſted in the face of Jeſus, which <hi>they know not, neither will they underſtand,</hi> Pſal. 82. 5.</p>
            <p>Herein they ſhould be directed in all matters to a right diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between good and bad, and ſo how they ought to be a terror to evil works, and for the praiſe and encouragement of them that do well, and to adminiſter juſtice equally: they ſhould by it be enabled to ſcatter the wicked with their eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bring the wheel over them, being through it made quick-ſighted, rightly to diſcern and judge them; and ſo directed by knowledge to demean themſelves towards them: for by mercy and truth the King is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; which mercy &amp; truth are onely diſcerned in one, or agreeing in Jeſus Chriſt, in whom they are met together for us, and do thence ſpring joyntly forth in the ſtreames and vertues of them, to the Kings preſervation; and in the light, inſtructions and teachings of them, to his direction, and ſo alſo for his preſervation in the way, <hi>And ſo by mercy is his throne upholden,</hi> Prov. 20. 8, 26, 28. <hi>Theſe things alſo belong to the wiſe; it's good not to have reſpect of perſons in judgement,</hi> &amp;c.

Therefore ſaith the wiſdom of God, <hi>Get wiſdom, get underſtanding, forget it not, neither decline from the words of my mouth; forſake her not, and ſhe ſhall preſerve thee; love her, and ſhe ſhall keep thee.

things of leaſt concernment, accounted ſtrange things, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 8. 12. The Viſion of all, a ſealed Book, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 11. and ſo they made the word of the Lord to themſelves, <hi>Line upon line, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon precept, here a little, and there a little:</hi> that ſo while pretending to be zealous and ſtrict in obſerving that rule, yet they in ſuch their walkings or going on fell backward, were broken, ſnared and taken: and for their ſcornfulneſs, God threatened to ſend or permit to them ſuch kinde of teachers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 10, 11. and leave them to ſuch blindeneſs, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 11, 12, 15. Take heed therefore of that great evil, and ſeek to be well furniſhed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in that key of knowledge, the teſtimony of Jeſus, and to learn skil to uſe it, as by it you are taught: refuſe not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of inſtruction, that by this wiſdom of God, Jeſus Chriſt, as declared in the Goſpel, are brought to you: better it is for you, now to fall down under thoſe bands, and not to break thoſe cords, but ſuffer them to have their operation, to the humbling you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, then to make your ſelves of that number that ſhall after be bound in everlaſting chains and fetters by that Word and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, the reproofs of which were proudly rejected by them, and by that deſpiſed people, that were inſtruments ſent now to perſwade them.</p>
            <p>You have much need of wiſdom in the knowledge of Chriſt, and of much skill to make uſe of it, that you may put on the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as to every matter. It's true, every wiſe and gracious man is not meet, nor every way furniſhed to be a Governour in this preſent World: and it's as true, that an unwiſe man in the knowledge of God in Jeſus Chriſt, an ungracious man, will not be a juſt Ruler, or good Magiſtrate. <hi>He that ruleth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men, muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God: and ſo he ſhall be as the clear ſhining after rain, and as the light of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the Sun riſeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even a morning without Clouds,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 3, 4, 5. Now though <hi>Davids</hi> houſe be not ſo with God, this was not found perfectly in him, or <hi>Solomon;</hi> and if not in them, then in no mortal man (whoſe breath is in his noſtrils) to be expected, but it ſhall be fully verified and found true onely in that Son of <hi>David,</hi> The ſure mercies of <hi>David;</hi> concerning whom, and of the everlaſting righteous and peaceable Kingdom in and by him, the everlaſting Covenant was made with <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:118359:79"/>
(as comparing with this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3, 4. with <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 34.) and in this was all his deſire and ſalvation, though in this day he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it not: but ſhall as certainly when it comes, as they that then ſurvive. Though this is true, I ſay, That the truth of this will be onely perfectly found in him, at whom <hi>David</hi> alſo had an eſpecial eye; yet this alſo is true, That the way for Rulers now to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and ſtrengthened to rule juſtly, and ſo as they may be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and mercy to the Nations over whom they are ſet, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a meaſure as they are capable, is, to ſet the fear of God before their eyes, and rule according to the light, inſtructions and guidance thereof. 'Tis a true ſaying of the Preacher, <hi>Better is a</hi> poor and <hi>wiſe Child, then a King</hi> that is never ſo old ſetled in his Kingdom, or in yeers, or in policy after the wiſdom of this World, or in whatever other conſiderations beſides, <hi>that</hi> yet <hi>is fooliſh,</hi> and without underſtanding in the things of Chriſt, and ſo knows not the God of his Fathers, <hi>Ecleſ.</hi> 4. 13. This therefore is the main thing to be deſired for them: and their being furniſhed with it, will tend much to the good of all men, and particularly to ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and enlargement to Gods people under them, as may be much to the commodity and profit of all men amongſt whom they live, and is therefore ſo good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to be deſired for them <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
